        # ðŸ¦… US Equities ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
        
        ## Overview: 
        
            equities is a python library that allows easy access to the SEC's XLBR dataset.
            Parsed data is stored locally for ease of use. Data is returned in pandas
            dataframes. 
        
        ## TUTORIAL: 
        
        The library consists of two central objects, Universe and Company. 
        
        ## Universe: 
        
        A Universe should be thought of as a set of Companies. The universe object gives us the ability to download,
        access and purge our data. 
        
            from equities.objects import Universe
        
            universe = Universe()
        
        #### Downloading Data:
        
        On first use the universe is empty as we have not downloaded data. Before calling the download function we can 
        optionally supply the universe with an array of quarters and or an array of "CIK" (explained below) ints. 
        
            quarters = ["2019q1","2019q2","2019q3","2019q4","2020q1"] # quarters to be downloaded
            ciks = 50 # limits parsing to first 50 companies. 
        
        If no optional arguments are supplied, we will proceed to download the entire dataset and parse all companies. 
        
        To download data we call
        
            universe.download(quarters=quarters,ciks=ciks)
        
        The requested data will then be downloaded and saved locally. This means that anytime you reinstantiate the 
        universe object, python remembers what you have already parsed.
        
        #### Core Functionality:
        
        To see the number of companies in the universe we can do: 
        
            print(len(universe))
        
        Universe objects are indexable by a "CIK" or "Central Index Key" number. This is the unique identifier used by 
        the sec to identify companies. To get a full list of the cik numbers in the universe one can do: 
        
            print(universe.ciks)
        
        A dataframe summary of all companies in the universe is included in:
        
            print(universe.properties())
        
        To access the first company in the above list you can do: 
        
            first_cik = universe.ciks[0]
            print(universe[first_cik])
        
        This returns a Company Object.
        
        
        ## Company: 
        
        A Company object should be thought of as an abstract representation of a real company. Every 
        company must have an associated Universe of origin. 
        
            from equities.object import Company
        
        #### Accessing the Financial Statements
        
        Consider the first Company in our universe, universe[first_cik]. It is a Company object. 
        
            company = universe[first_cik]
        
        Dataframes of the company's financial statements over the universe in question is given by: 
        
            company.income()      # income statement dataframe
        
            company.balance()     # Balancesheet dataframe
        
            company.cash()        # Cash Flow Statement dataframe
        
            company.equity()      # Consolidatad Equity dataframe
        
        
        #### Additional Company Methods
        
            company.name()        # Returns company name
            company.sic()         # Returns company sic group
