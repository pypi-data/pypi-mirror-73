"""
The MQLib module provides a python interface to the MQLib C++ library, as
described in https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2017.0798 .
It can be used to access dozens of heuristics for Max-Cut and Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), two famous NP-hard problems.
Additionally, it provides access to a hyperheuristic, which predicts for a
given problem instance what the best-performing heuristic will be, and then
runs that one.

        Construct a new 'Instance' object given the problem data. For
        Max-Cut, this is either a networkx graph or a matrix containing
        the (weighted) adjacency matrix for the graph. For QUBO, this
        is a square matrix Q. IMPORTANT: both the adjacency matrix and Q
        are symmetric. When inputting a matrix, you can either input the
        full symmetric matrix or you can input either the upper or lower
        triangular portion of the matrix. If an upper triangular matrix is
        inputted, then it is assumed that the exact same values will
        appear in the lower triangular piece. Similarly, if a lower
        triangular matrix is inputted, then it is assumed that the exact
        same values will appear in the upper triangular piece.

def runHeuristic(heuristic, instance, rtsec, seed=-1):
    """
    Run a specified heuristic on a given problem instance. Briefly, Max-Cut
    involves finding a partition of the nodes in the graph with the largest
    sum of edge weights between the two groups. Meanwhile, QUBO defines a
    square matrix Q and seeks to find the binary-valued column vector q that
    maximizes q'Qq.

    Heuristics are run until the specified runtime limit is reached. If the
    heuristic and instance are of different types (e.g. the heuristic solves
    Max-Cut but the instance is a QUBO instance), then the instance will be
    converted to the other problem type, solved with the heuristic, and then
    the solution will be converted back to the original problem.

    :param heuristic: The code of the heuristic, as returned by the
    MQLib.getHeuristics() function. The special code of "HH" runs a
    hyperheuristic, which uses machine learning to predict the best-performing
    heuristic based on instance characteristics and then runs that one.
    :param instance: A MQLib.Instance object to be optimized.
    :param rtsec: The runtime limit (wall clock time for heuristic execution),
    in seconds
    :param seed: A seed to ensure reproducible heuristic results. -1 indicates
    the current time should be used to seed the PRNG.
    :return: Returns a dict with a number of pieces of information. Key
    "heuristic" indicates the heuristic that was run (only informative for
    the hyperheuristic). "instance" is the passed MQLib.Instance object.
    "objval" is the best objective value found (sum of edge weights for Max-Cut
    or value of q'Qq for QUBO), and "solution" is a solution that achieved
    that best objective value (1/0 valued for QUBO and 1/-1 valued for Max-Cut).
    "bestsolhistory_objvals" and "bestsolhistory_runtimes" indicate the
    chronological list of all best objective values found by the heuristic,
    along with the wall clock times taken to achieve each of these values.
