        ======================
        collective.siteimprove
        ======================
        
        This package is a Plone add-on that provides integration with
        `siteimprove.com <http://siteimprove.com>`_, a service for maintaining and improving website
        content. Siteimprove provides customers with automated scans of their websites
        which check for content quality, accessibility compliance, SEO, and
        performance.  The add-on gives content editors immediate feedback on
        the quality of pages that they publish, with a summary report provided
        in a page overlay and links to more details. This lets Siteimprove
        customers see problems while they are in the process of editing a page
        on their Plone site, instead of getting emailed a report after the
        fact and needing to click through links to fix things.
        
        collective.siteimprove provides the integration with Siteimprove's
        `CMS plugin <https://siteimprove.com/en-us/core-platform/integrations/cms-plugin/>`_
        API that is required to provide these features. The only thing Plone
        admins need to do is install the add-on and configure a Siteimprove
        token.
        
        For more information on using Siteimprove within Plone, 
        see `How to navigate the Siteimprove CMS Plugin
        <https://support.siteimprove.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115000075451-How-to-navigate-the-Siteimprove-CMS-Plugin>`_.

        Customization
        -------------
        
        This add-on creates a new permission "collective.siteimprove: Use Siteimprove" 
        (zcml id "collective.siteimprove.UseSiteimprove") for viewing Siteimprove screens 
        and requesting content scans. This permission is assigned to the "Editor", "Reviewer", 
        "Site Administrator", and "Manager" roles by default. Those assignments can be
        changed via the ZMI or custom code.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.siteimprove by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.siteimprove
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``.
        
        Install the Add-on from the Plone Add-ons control panel under Site Setup.
        Then go to the Siteimprove control panel and request a new token
        (or paste in an existing one), and save.
