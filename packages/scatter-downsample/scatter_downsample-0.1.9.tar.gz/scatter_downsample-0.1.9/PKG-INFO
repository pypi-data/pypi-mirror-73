Description: # Downsampling high resolution images using the scattering transform
        Atlasing high resolution data
        
        Scattering transform
        
        visualization of imges
        
        downsampling with multiple methods
        
        # Usage
        ## ScatterDown(img,ndown2,filtered_std=2):
        Input:
        
            - img: input image
            - ndown2: how many times to downsample by a factor of 2
            - filtered_std: how many standard deviations maximum should not get filtered out (default 2)
        
        Output: 
        
            - high dimensional image
            - labels for each channel
            - an example visualization that you save as a png file
        
        # Tests
        installed by: `python -m unittest tests/testcase.py`
        
        - a small (256,256,3) image to test for the shape of output image and labels
