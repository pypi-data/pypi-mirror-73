> Audiobook alignment for Indigenous languages!

This library is an end-to-end audio/text aligner. It is meant to be used together with the [ReadAlong-Web-Component](https://github.com/roedoejet/ReadAlong-Web-Component) to interactively visualize the alignment.

## Background

The concept is a web application with a series of stages of
processing, which ultimately leads to a time-aligned audiobook -
i.e. a package of:

- SMIL file describing time alignments
- TEI file describing text
- Audio file (WAV or MP3)

Which can be loaded using the read-along [web component](https://github.com/roedoejet/ReadAlong-Web-Component).

Optionally a book can be generated as a standalone HTML page or
as an ePub file.

1. (optional) Pre-segment inputs, consisting of:
   - Single audio file
   - Text with page markings (assume paragraph breaks = pages)
2. Input pages: each page consists of
   - Image file
   - Audio file
   - Text
3. Run alignment
4. View output and download components

## Install

The best thing to do is install with pip `pip install readalongs`. 

Otherwise, clone the repo and pip install it locally.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dhdaines/ReadAlong-Studio.git
$ cd ReadAlong-Studio
$ pip install -e .
```

On windows, you must first install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) ([helpful instructions](https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/)), [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017) (search for "Build Tools", select C++ when prompted) and [swigwin](http://www.swig.org/download.html).

## Usage

ReadAlong-Studio can be used either through the command line, a distributed web application or Docker.

### CLI

Below shows some basic commands. For more information about how the command line interface works, please check the [documentation](https://readthedocs.org/). Additionally, you can add the `--help` flag to any command for more information.

#### Alignment

Basic alignment is done with the following command.

`readalongs align TEXTFILE WAVFILE OUTPUTNAME`

#### ePub

In order to generate an ePub, there are two steps:

1. `readalongs align --output-xhtml TEXTFILE WAVFILE OUTPUTNAME`
2. `readalongs epub OUTPUTNAME.smil OUTPUTNAME.epub`

### Studio web application

ReadAlong-Studio has a web interface for creating interactive audiobooks. The web app can be served by first installing ReadAlong-Studio and then running `readalongs run`. A web app will then be available on port 5000.

### Docker

If you are having trouble installing the package, you can also clone the repo and run the studio using Docker.

To build the Docker container, run:

    docker build . --tag=readalong-studio

To run the Flask web app from the Docker container:

    docker run -p 5000:5000 -it readalong-studio

Then you should be able to visit http://localhost:5000/.
