Description: PyCloudy is a Python library to deal with input and output files of Cloudy (Gary Ferland) photoionization code.
        Is also allows to generate 3D nebula from various runs of the 1D Cloudy code.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        You will need to have installed `Cloudy <http://nublado.org/>`_ .
        PyCloudy uses numpy and other standard python libraries.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You may find useful to download, install and upgrade pyCloudy using
        `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ .
        
        For example:
        
        * pip install pyCloudy
        
        Updates use the same command. You can also use 
        
        * easy_install pyCloudy
        
        To use the devel package (at your own risks!!!):
        
        * pip install -U git+https://github.com/Morisset/pyCloudy.git
        
        Warranty
        ========
        
        PyCloudy is provided as it is. No Warranty at all, you cannot complain if it runs models which are not fitting your data! :-)
        
        Manual
        ======
        
        * There is no manual for now... There will soon be a HowTo page.
        
        * But... there is some examples of use in the `pyCloudy home page
          <https://sites.google.com/site/pycloudy/>`_ .
          
        * And the reference manual is accessible from this site `HERE
          <https://morisset.github.io/pyCloudy_Manual/html/index.html>`_ .
