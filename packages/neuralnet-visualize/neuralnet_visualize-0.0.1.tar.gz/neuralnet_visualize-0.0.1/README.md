# Neural Network Visualizer

## What it is?

A module which creates a neural network with the given architecture(only Dense layers)

## Installation

Run the below command to install the package in linux
```shell
$ sudo apt install graphviz
```

Run the below command to install the python wrapper of the Graphviz
```shell
$ sudo pip3 install graphviz
```

## How it looks?

## Future Works

* Add Convolutional layers, Maxpooling, Flatten layers, LSTM's
* Specific colors for activation functions
* Specific colors for types of layers
