# [Markdown Live Preview](https://ms-jpq.github.io/markdown-live-preview)

## Features

- **Live Preview:** Updates preview on file save

- **Auto Follow:** Focus on edited element

- **Syntax Highlight:** Automatically use [`highlightjs`](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) if `node` is available

- **Github flavoured:** Looks familiar

## Preview

The animation is only choppy because it's a compressed gif.

## [Install](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-live-preview)

```sh
pip install -U markdown_live_preview
```

## Embedding

Markdown Live Preview (MLP) can be embedded into other applications as a subprocess.

The flag `--read-stdin` is designed such that MLP can read markdown chunks from nul delimited stdin, and process them accordingly.

## Future Improvements

Currently the "reconciliation" stage uses a single pass `O(n)` naive algorithm.

This does not recognize row insertion / deletion / rotation. As a result, we have some issues with some false highlights.

A more sophisticated colouring algorithm is required.
