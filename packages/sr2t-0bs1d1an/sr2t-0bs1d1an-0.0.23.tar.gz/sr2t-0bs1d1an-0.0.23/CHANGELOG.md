# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Ideas]

- Figure out a way, if at all useful, to print more details (software versions; Nmap script output).
- Add more useful parsers?
- Look into grouping similar observations when outputting to XLSX
- Not sure if useful, but look into adding an optional Nessus column to print each finding details.

Have a look at the YAML files in the 'sr2t/data' folder to see how you can create your own custom YAML files.
