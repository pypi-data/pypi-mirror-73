Features
--------
- This module allows inference with a pretrained poolnet saliency detector model.


Credits
-------
- This package is a slight modification of the repository found at https://github.com/backseason/PoolNet which is the implementation of the model described in the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09569 by the original authors.
- The images in the tests/test_data folder are from the ECSSD dataset.  More information on that dataset can be found at the following link: http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/leojia/projects/hsaliency/dataset.html.
- This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.
