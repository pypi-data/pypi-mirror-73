Description: # Lantern: safer than a torch
        
        Lantern is a software package to support SMT analysis of affine
        multiplexing neural networks using PyTorch and Z3.
        
        See: [docs/lantern/](docs/lantern/index.html) for (generated) documentation.
        
        See: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for dependencies.
        
        An annotated `example.py` demonstrates basic usage.
        
        Lantern was developed against `torch==1.5.0` and `z3-solver==4.8.7.0`.
        Linear Real Arithmetic appears to be stable, but we have noticed some changes
        to the floating point solvers as z3 continues to be developed.
