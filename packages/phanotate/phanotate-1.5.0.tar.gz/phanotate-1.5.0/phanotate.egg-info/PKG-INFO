Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        PHANOTATE is a tool to annotate phage genomes.  It uses the assumption that non-coding
        bases in a phage genome is disadvantageous, and then populates a weighted graph to
        find the optimal path through the six frames of the DNA where open reading frames
        are beneficial paths, while gaps and overlaps are penalized paths.
        
        To install `PHANOTATE`,
        ```
        pip3 install phanotate
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```sh
         git clone https://github.com/deprekate/PHANOTATE.git
         cd PHANOTATE
         python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        
        PHANOTATE Example
        --------------
        
        Run on included sample data:
        ```sh
        ./phanotate.py tests/NC_001416.1.fasta 
        ```
        Output is the predicted ORFs, and should look like
        ```sh
        125     187     +
        191     736     +
        741     2636    +
        2633    2839    +
        2836    4437    +
        4319    5737    +
        ...
        ```
