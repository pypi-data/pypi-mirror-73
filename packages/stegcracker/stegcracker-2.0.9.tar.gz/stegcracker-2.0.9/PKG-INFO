        Steganography brute-force utility to uncover hidden data inside files.
        
        ## Usage
        Using stegcracker is simple, pass a file to it as it's first parameter and 
        optionally pass the path to a wordlist of passwords to try as it's second 
        parameter. If you don't specify the wordlist, the tool will try to use the 
        built-in rockyou.txt wordlist which ships with Kali Linux. If you are running a 
        different distribution, you can download the rockyou wordlist 
        [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz).
        
        ```
        $ stegcracker <file> [<wordlist>]
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        The program requires Python 3.6 and the steghide binary to be installed. If 
        python 3.6 is not installed, check out [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/332641/how-to-install-python-3-6)
        guide on how to do so, and steghide can be installed by using the following command:
        
        ```
        $ sudo apt-get install steghide -y
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        To install the program, run the following command:
        
        ```
        $ pip3.6 install stegcracker
        ```
        
        ## Updating
        To update the program, simply pass `-U` to the installation command:
        
        ```
        $ pip3.6 install stegcracker -U --force-reinstall
        ```

        ## Upgrading from 1.X
        If you're upgrading StegCracker from the original 1.X release, please remove the existing version first:
        
        ```
        $ sudo rm --force $(which stegcracker)
        ```
        
        ## Looking for the old version?
        While I reccomended using the latest and greatest version, you might want to install the older version of StegCracker (you might not be able to install Python 3.6 on your platform, or you're just feeling nostalgic, I don't blame you). You can download it from the [v1.0.0 tag](https://github.com/Paradoxis/StegCracker/blob/v1.0.0/stegcracker) _(note: all issues or pull requests regarding this version will be be ignored)_.
