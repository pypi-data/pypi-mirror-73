Description: # Visual-Kinematics
        
        This is a super simple but useful python package which helps to calculate the robot robot kinematics and visualizing trajectory in just a few lines of code.  
        
        You have to deal with neither vector and matrix algebra, nor inverse kinematics, as long as there are robot's D-H parameters, you are good to go.
        
        If you are unfamiliar with D-H parameters, please read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denavit%E2%80%93Hartenberg_parameters).
