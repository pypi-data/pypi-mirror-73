Telesync
========

Telesync is a lightweight library for programming interactive web applications
entirely in Python (no HTML/Javascript/CSS) required.

It is designed to make it fast, fun and easy to build low-latency, realtime,
collaborative, web-based applications. It ships batteries-included with
a suite of form and data visualization components for rapidly prototyping
analytical and decision-support applications.

Telesync's components work in conjunction with the Telesync relay server
that facilitates realtime state synchronization between Python and web browsers.

The Telesync relay server is built into H2O.ai Q for enterprise-grade hosting.
