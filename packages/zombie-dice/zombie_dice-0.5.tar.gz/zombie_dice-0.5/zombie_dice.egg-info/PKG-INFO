Description: # Zombie Dice
        
        This package is based on Zombie Dice - a popular dice-rolling, push-your-luck boardgame by Steven Jackson.
        
        By running a series of simple functions within a Python environment, you can push your luck to get the most BRAAAAIINS!! as possible.
        
        You can also analyse your results by checking out the logs of your rounds and overall game.
        
        - STEP 1: Once initialised, players are required to pick 3 dice from the bucket by running pick_dice()
        - STEP 2: After they've picked the dice with specific colours, players are required to roll the dice by running roll_dice()
        - STEP 3: Player can pick more dice and re-roll if they choose to - remember footprints are included in the re-pick and re-throw, so keep in mind of the colours
        - STEP 4: Player can keep pick and roll untill the 13 dice are exhausted and the round finished or player can end the round when they feel like they've amounted enough points. Run end_round() to end the round and the next player can continue
        
        The first player to reach a total of 13 points wins the game!
