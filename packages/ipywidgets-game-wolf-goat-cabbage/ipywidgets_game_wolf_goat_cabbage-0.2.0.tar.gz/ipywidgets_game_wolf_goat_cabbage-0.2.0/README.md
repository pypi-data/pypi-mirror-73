# Wolf Goat Cabbage game with Jupyter Notebook

The goal is to make the wolf, the goat and the cabbage cross the river with a two-seats boat. 
The wolf cannot be left alone with the goat and the goat cannot be left alone with the cabbage. 

There are two ways to interact with the game :
* Using the buttons 
* Execute code in the cells below the visualisation
