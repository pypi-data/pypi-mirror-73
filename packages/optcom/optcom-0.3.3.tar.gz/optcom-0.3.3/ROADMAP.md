# Optcom Roadmap

This file aims to list the future tasks that could be made in Optcom.
Anyone is more than welcome to participate or to suggest new idea.
Please ask administrators for more details on a specific task.

- Temperature dependent non-linear Schr√∂dinger equations for fiber propagation
([ref](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/9/1640/pdf)) N.B.: Thermal lensing
might be taken into account.

- Four Wave Mixing effect. The whole framework and options for it are
ready, must only code the effect. (cf. Kerr effect) ([ref](https://www.elsevier.com/books/nonlinear-fiber-optics/agrawal/978-0-12-397023-7))

- Theoretical framework for fiber losses. ([ref](https://www.elsevier.com/books/nonlinear-fiber-optics/agrawal/978-0-12-397023-7))

- Effective use of multi-cpu computation.

- Use of gpu computation.

- Dynamic step update in field stepper computation.

- Time dependent population densities in the rate equations of the
fiber amplifier NLSE. (most of it is ready)

- Extend equations to vector model to take the two polarization
components into account.

- Extend fiber to birefringent material (need vector model of equations).

- Multi-mode and doping profile in fiber amplifier. ([ref](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26297737_Numerical_modeling_of_transverse_mode_competition_in_strongly_pumped_multimode_fiber_lasers_and_amplifiers))
