Description: LF Docs Config
        ==============
        
        The purpose of this project is to allow LF projects a centralized location for
        storing common project configuration.
        
        To use this a project should create a conf.yaml file in the same
        directory as their conf.py. Conf.py should contain at minimum::
        
            from docs_conf import *
        
        The conf.yaml file should contain at minimum::
        
            ---
            project_cfg=myproject
        
        If defaults for 'myproject' exist, they will be loaded from this
        package, otherwise the basic Sphinx defaults will be set.
        
        Configuration precedence for configuration is as follows:
        
        #. project/conf.py
        #. project/conf.yaml
        #. docs_conf/defaults/{project_cfg}.yaml
        #. docs_conf/defaults/default.yaml
        #. docs_conf/__init__.py
        
        conf.py structure and documentation:
          http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/config.html
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - [ ] Define the minimum set of config values to release initial version.
              These can probably come from ODL/OPNFV site conf.py files.
        
        - [ ] Use sane defaults, and don't error out if something is not set.
              Each config needs to be imported gracefully (if it doesn't
              exist, set None or something; similar to dict.get
        
        - [ ] Create own documentation for project detailing use of 'conf.cfg'
              file as some values will require subkeys given that they're
              dictionaries or expect a list of tuples.
        
        - [ ] Setup and document section. The documentation already is organized
              by section, so the config should also contain these section and look
              for their values under them.
        
              Sections:
        
                - general (aka sphinx)
                - project
                - i18n
                - html_output
                - apple_help
                - epub_output
                - latex_output
                - text_output
                - manpage_output
                - texinfo_output
                - linkcheck
                - xml
                - cplusplus
        
        - [ ] Configure pre-plugin sections, and reference by plugin listing.
