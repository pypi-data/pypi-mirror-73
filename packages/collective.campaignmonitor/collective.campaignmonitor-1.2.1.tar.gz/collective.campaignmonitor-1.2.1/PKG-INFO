        Campaign Monitor integration in Plone.
        
        Heavily based on `collective.mailchimp`_ by `Timo Stollenwerk`_
        
        Like `collective.mailchimp`_ this product provides a portlet and a view (@@cm-newsletter-subscribe) to let users subscribe to a newsletter.
        
        The product provides a configuration control panel to let sites admins enter the Campaing Monitor API Key and select a customer, this way the available list of this customer will be selectable both in the subscribe form and in the portlet.
        
        This product has been tested on Plone 5.1 and above.
