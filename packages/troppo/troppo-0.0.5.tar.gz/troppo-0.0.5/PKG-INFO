        TROPPO
        ============
        
        *Troppo* (Tissue-specific RecOnstruction and Phenotype Prediction using Omics data) is a Python package containing methods
        for tissue specific reconstruction to use with constraint-based models. The main purpose of this package is to provide
        an open-source framework which is both modular and flexible to be integrated with other packages, such as cobrapy, framed
        or cameo whose already provide generic data structures to interpret metabolic models.
        
        A (MI)LP solver is required to use most of the present methods. The current methods support optlang, which in turn allow
        the use of solvers like CPLEX or Gurobi.
        
        The current methods implemented are:
            - FastCORE
            - CORDA
            - GIMME
            - (t)INIT
            - iMAT
        
        Methods to be implemented later:
            - MBA
            - mCADRE
            - PRIME
