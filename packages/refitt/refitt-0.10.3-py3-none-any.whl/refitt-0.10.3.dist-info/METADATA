`REFITT <https://www.refitt.org>`_ is an autonomous machine learning system that yields optimal
observing strategies in real time to participating facilities, instruments, and astronomers. It
subscribes to LSST data brokers and forecasts supernova light curves. Recommendations are created
for individual subscribers based on availability and capability.


Documentation
-------------

REFITT is not a meant as a public tool, yet it's construction and administration are made available
for transparency and understanding. It's open REST API is documented, making it possible to automate
the use of REFITT without needing to interact with the web interface.

An overview of the system, configuration and deployment instructions, and other documentation can be
found online at `refitt.readthedocs.io <https://refitt.readthedocs.io>`_.
