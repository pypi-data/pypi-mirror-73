## ntscli cloud library

The ntscli cloud library relays messages to target Automators by connecting to the AWS IoT broker.
It is analogous to the pilot library kaiju-automator-lib, which did this by connecting directly to the target RAE through exposed firewall 
ports. 

In very general terms, the `mqtt-router` service listens for commands on the AWS IoT instance we maintain and proxies traffic over bridged 
MQTT topics to the target RAE. We plan to implement the functionality described in the features directory.

We can:

* list devices behind an Automator
* check if a given ESN has an EyePatch on it
* get, run, and cancel test plans on specified devices
* monitor progress of running test plans on devices and/or RAEs
* get status of the Automator for devices
* collect past results for known batch IDs from the recent past

For specifics, please refer to the files in features/*.feature.
