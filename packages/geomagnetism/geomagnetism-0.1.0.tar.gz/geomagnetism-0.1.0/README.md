# Release History
0.0.2 correct pole ambiguity by using limitig value of associated Legendre polynomial
0.0.3 create geomagnetic field cartography using PlateCarree representation. 'Miller' would be better)
0.0.9 plot the iso values of the field. Support Millet, stereographic an Lambert projection
