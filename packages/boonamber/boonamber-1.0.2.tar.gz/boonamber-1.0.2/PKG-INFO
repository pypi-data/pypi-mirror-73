Description: # Boon Amber Python SDK
        
        An SDK for Boon Amber sensor analytics
        
        ## Installation
        
        The Boon Amber SDK is a Python 3 project and can be installed via pip. After cloning the `amber-python-sdk` repository to the current directory, run:
        
        ```
        pip install boonamber
        ```
        
        ## Credentials setup
        
        Note: An account in the Boon Amber cloud must be obtained from Boon Logic to use the Amber SDK.
        
        The account credentials should be placed in a file named _~/.Amber.license_:
        
        ```
        {
            "default": {
                "username": "AMBER-ACCOUNT-USERNAME",
                "password": "AMBER-ACCOUNT-PASSWORD"
            }
        }
        ```
        
        The _~/.Amber.license_ file will be consulted by the Amber SDK to successfully find and authenticate with your Amber account credentials. Credentials may optionally be provided instead via the environment variables `AMBER_USERNAME` and `AMBER_PASSWORD`.
        
        ## Connectivity test
        
        The following Python script provides a basic proof-of-connectivity:
        
        **connect-example.py**
        
        ```
        from boonamber import AmberClient
        
        # At initialization the client discovers Amber account credentials
        # under the "default" entry in the ~/.Amber.license file.
        amber = AmberClient()
        
        # These credentials are used to authenticate against the Amber cloud.
        amber.authenticate()
        
        # The client is then authenticated for one hour of use, and may
        # re-authenticate at any time with another call to authenticate().
        sensors = amber.list_sensors()
        print("sensors: {}".format(sensors))
        ```
        
        Running the connect-example.py script should yield output like the following:
        ```
        $ python connect-example.py
        sensors: {}
        ```
        where the dictionary `{}` lists all sensors that currently exist under the given Boon Amber account.
