"""Class @decorator for defining exquisite settings configurations.

Concepts
--------

A configurable setting is some value in an application that can be
"globally" set.

Most often, a configurable setting is used so that an end user can
change the behavior of an application. All settings might be saved
to a file on disk and read whenever the application starts. In this
case, the collection of configurable settings might simply be called
the "user options".

But you could also use configurable settings to decouple code. For
example, rather than two objects sharing values by interacting with
one another, they could instead share values using a common settings
configuration. Then the two objects only need to know common key names,
and not about each other.

At its core, each setting has a name (its key), and a value. The value could
be a default value specified in code, or it could be a value somehow specified
by the user, such as from the command line, or from an environment variable,
or from a file saved on disk.

Furthermore, each setting has a description (some helpful text),
a type (int, bool, list, etc.),
an optional validation function,
and other qualities
(see more in the ``key_chained_val`` module).

Multiple settings can be organized into
hierarchically-related groups, or sections
(as represented by the :class:`ConfigDecorator` class,
but generated using the ``@section`` decorator).

In addition to settings, each section may also contain sections
(or, more aptly, *subsections*).

You can think of the complete hierarchical collection of sections and
their settings as a *settings configuration*, or as the *user options*.

Each section of a settings configuration is represented by a
:class:`ConfigDecorator` instance. The settings themselves are
each represented by a ``KeyChainedVal`` instance.

Typical usage
-------------

To create a settings configuration, use the ``@section`` decorator
once to designate the root object of the settings configuration.
The decorated class is then used to decorate each subsection class,
as well as each settings method. (And then the subsection classes can
be used to decorate sub-subsections and their settings, and so on.)

For example::

    def generate_config(self):
        '''An example setting configuration generator.'''

        @section(None)
        class RootSection(object):
            pass

        @RootSection.section('foo')
        class RootSectionFoo(object):
            def __init__(self):
                pass

        @RootSection.section('bar')
        class RootSectionBar(object):
            def __init__(self):
                pass

        @RootSectionBar.section('baz')
        class BarSubsectionBaz(object):
            def __init__(self):
                pass

            @property
            @RootSectionBar.setting(
                "An example setting.",
            )
            def bat(self):
                return 'Ta-Da!'

        return RootSection

In the example above, there are two root sections defined, "foo" and "bar".
And there's one setting defined in the "bar.baz" subsection. You could run,
e.g.,::

    >>> cfg = generate_config()
    >>> cfg.bar.baz.bat
    'Ta-Da!'

Note that because of how decorators operate on a class (they execute
after the class is defined), the settings defined in a class definition
must be decoratored using that class's parent section. (In the previous
example, ``@RootSectionBar.setting`` was used inside ``BarSubsectionBaz``.)

.. Important::

  - You cannot access the decorated user class using its name.

    - The ``@section`` decorator wraps the class definition in a
      :class:`ConfigDecorator` instance, and it returns that object.

    - So in the previous example,
      ``RootSection`` is a :class:`ConfigDecorator` instance
      and not a ``class`` object.
      I.e., you cannot call ``obj = RootSection()``.

class ConfigDecorator(object):
    """Represents one section of a hierarchical settings configuration.

    A settings configuration is a collection of user-settable key-value
    settings grouped and organized into a tree-like graph of sections.

    A settings configuration has one root section, which may have any number
    of subsections and settings therein. Each subsection may also contain
    any number of subsections and settings.

    Each :class:`ConfigDecorator` wraps a user class that defines
    the settings in that section.
    To add subsections to a section, use the section object's
    :func:`ConfigDecorator.section` decorator.
    One or more classes are defined and decorated this way
    to build a hierarchical settings configuration.

    .. Important::

        Users of this library do not call :class:`ConfigDecorator()` directly.

        Rather, object creation is handled by the
        :meth:`config_decorator.section` and
        :func:`ConfigDecorator.section`
        decorators.

        cls: The class being decorated.

        _parent: A reference to the parent :class:`ConfigDecorator` section,
                 or ``None`` for the root section.
        _kv_cache: An ordered dict of settings defined by the class,
                   used internally when build the settings configuration
                   (i.e., used internally while sourcing Python code).
        _key_vals: This section's settings, stored as a dict
                   (setting name ⇒
                   :class:`config_decorator.key_chained_val.KeyChainedValue` object).
