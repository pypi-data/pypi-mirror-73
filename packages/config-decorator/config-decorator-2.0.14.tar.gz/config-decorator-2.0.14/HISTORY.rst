.. :changelog:

2.0.14 (2020-07-02)
===================

- Docs: Update documentation.

2.0.13 (2020-06-29)
===================

- Bugfix: Avoid typifying value (e.g., to str) before conform callback.

2.0.12 (2020-04-25)
===================

- Feature: Option to collect errors on update, rather than raise.

2.0.11 (2020-04-25)
===================

- Bugfix: ``apply_edits`` returning *mutated* default.

2.0.10 (2020-04-18)
===================

- Bugfix: ``as_dict`` excludes custom user settings because not marked from-config.

  - That is, when a client calls ``update_gross`` to add free-form custom user
    config (i.e., settings that were not defined by an ``@section``-decorated
    config function), be sure to mark the values as from-config, and not
    from-default. Otherwise, ``as_dict`` ignores the values, thinking they're
    not from the user.

- Bugfix: When ``apply_items`` extracts config dict, ``skip_unset`` not honored.

- Feature: Option to include section even if all keys were excluded (``as_dict``).

- Feature: New classmethod for re-rooting section.
