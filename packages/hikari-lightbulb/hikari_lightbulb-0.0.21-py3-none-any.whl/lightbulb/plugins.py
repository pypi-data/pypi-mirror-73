class Plugin:
    """
    Independent class that can be loaded and unloaded from the bot
    to allow for hot-swapping of commands.

    To use in your own bot you should subclass this for each plugin
    you wish to create. Don't forget to cal ``super().__init__()`` if you
    override the ``__init__`` method.

    Args:
        name (Optional[ :obj:`str` ]): The name to register the plugin under. If unspecified will be the class name.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            import lightbulb
            from lightbulb import plugins, commands

            bot = lightbulb.Bot(token="token_here", prefix="!")

            class MyPlugin(plugins.Plugin):

                @commands.command()
                async def ping(self, ctx):
                    await ctx.send("Pong!")

            bot.add_plugin(MyPlugin())
    """
