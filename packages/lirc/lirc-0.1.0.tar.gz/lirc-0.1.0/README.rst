This is a python package that allows you to interact with the daemon in the
`Linux Infrared Remote Control <https://lirc.org>`_ package. Interacting with
the daemon allows you to send IR signals from a computer.

More information on the lircd daemon, socket interface,
reply packet format, etc. can be found at https://www.lirc.org/html/lircd.html

Installation
------------

This package is hosted on PyPI and can be installed
through pip.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install lirc

However since this is a wrapper around the LIRC daemon, it
is expected that LIRC is installed and setup on the given
system as well.

More information on that can be found in the `installation <https://lirc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_
portion of the documentation.

Using the Lirc Package
----------------------

.. code-block:: python

  from lirc import Lirc

  lirc = Lirc()
  response = lirc.version()

  print(response.command)
  >>> 'VERSION'
  print(response.success)
  >>> True
  print(response.data)
  >>> ['0.10.1']

To get started with the package, we import ``Lirc`` and can
initialize it with the defaults by passing it no arguments.

This will assume a socket path of ``/var/run/lirc/lircd``.
Furthermore, this will also then assume a socket connection
using ``AF_UNIX`` and ``SOCK_STREAM``. These are both the defaults
that should work on a Linux system. There are ports of LIRC
to Windows and macOS but using the package there is far less
common. However, both of these are configurable through options
passed to ``Lirc`` to allow it to be used on those operating systems
as well.

After sending any command to the LIRC daemon, this package will create
a ``LircResponse`` for us that it returns. That response contains the
command we sent to LIRC, whether it was successful, and any data that
was returned back to us.
