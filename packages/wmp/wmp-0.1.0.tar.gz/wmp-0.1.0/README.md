# wmp-face

wmp-face is a Python module for face detection & recognition built on 
top of dlib's facial recognizer.

This codebase was developed under Wesleyan Media Project - a research
group that tracks all election-related advertising to give journalists
and political scientists the data and the tools to hold governments and
special interests accountable. Mostly notably, wmp-face was instrumental
in pre-processing the data used for "Do Women Candidates 'Run as Women'
Online?" (Yao, et al.).
