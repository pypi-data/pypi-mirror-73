Description: # wmp-face
        
        wmp-face is a Python module for face detection & recognition built on 
        top of dlib's facial recognizer.
        
        This codebase was developed under Wesleyan Media Project - a research
        group that tracks all election-related advertising to give journalists
        and political scientists the data and the tools to hold governments and
        special interests accountable. Mostly notably, wmp-face was instrumental
        in pre-processing the data used for "Do Women Candidates 'Run as Women'
        Online?" (Yao, et al.).
