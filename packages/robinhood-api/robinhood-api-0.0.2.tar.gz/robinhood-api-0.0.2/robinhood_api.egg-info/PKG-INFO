Description: # robinhood
        the unofficial Robinhood API (pre-alpha)
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/james-yun/robinhood.git
        cd robinhood
        python3 example.py
        ```
        I hope to publish to the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager once this production ready.
        
        ## Authentication
        The first time you log in, you will be prompted to verify your identity by entering a code send to your phone or email. 
        This will generate an OAuth bearer token that will be stored in tokens.json. 
        Subsequent logins will not require your credentials.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import robinhood
        
        
        # you will be prompted for your username and password
        robinhood.login()  
        
        # check your stocks
        print(robinhood.positions())
        ```
