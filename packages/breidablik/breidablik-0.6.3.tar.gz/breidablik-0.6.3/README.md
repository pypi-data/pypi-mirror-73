# Breidablik
An interpolation routine and abundance predictor wrapper around stellar spectra for lithium generated from Balder (Amarsi et al. 2016) and the Stagger-grid (Magic et al. 2013). The raw synthetic spectra and models can be found on http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ellawang/. We use `pyKrige` to interpolate between stellar parameters and lithium abundance inputs to generate interpolated stellar line profiles; and `scikit-learn` to interpolate between stellar parameters and stellar line strengths, these interpolation models are provided as part of the package. Using the interpolation routine, we can predict the lithium profile given any stellar parameters and lithium abundance input, we can also predict the lithium abundance given an observed spectrum and stellar parameters.

## Installation
### Install with pip
#### Automatic
If you are using linux/macOS, you can install using:
```
git clone https://github.com/ellawang44/Breidablik
cd Breidablik
./install_pip
```
#### Manual
If the above automatic installation did not work for you, then to install with `pip`, there are 3 steps:
1. Install Breidablik through `pip`. This will install Breidablik _without_ the raw synthetic spectra.  
2. Optional, download the raw data. Whilst Breidablik will happily interpolate and predict lithium abundances without the raw synthetic spectra, the raw spectra can be found in `balder.zip` on http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ellawang/. There are functions under `breidablik.analysis` which interact with the raw synthetic spectra.
3. Optional, put the raw data in the breidablik folder. The functions in `breidablik.analysis.read` have a `data_path` parameter which is the path to the folder containing the raw spectra. By default, this path is set to a folder named `Balder` inside the `breidablik` package. Therefore, I recommend putting the data inside the `Balder` folder inside the `breidablik` package; however, this is not a requirement.  

### Install without pip
#### Automatic
If you are using linux/macOS, you can navigate to where you want this repository and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/ellawang44/Breidablik
cd Breidablik
./install
```
Once the installation is done, you can delete this repository.

#### Manual
If the above automatic installation did not work for you, then to install without using `pip`, there are 5 steps:
1. Navigate to where you want this repository and clone this git repository.
2. Navigate into `Breidablik/breidablik`.
3. Download the models from `models.zip` on http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ellawang/ and unzip it.
4. Download the raw data from `balder.zip` on http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ellawang/ and unzip it.
5. Optional, add this directory to the python path. This makes the directory findable by python no matter where it is launched.

Optional, to check that the installation was successful, in the `Breidablik` folder, you can run:
```
python -m pytest
```
If all tests pass with no warnings, then the installation was successful. If you have installed this package through `pip`, you can still run the tests, but instead this will need to be done in the `breidablik` folder installed by `pip`.

## License and Citation
These data are still preliminary and will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Wang et al.). As they are still in a testing stage, please contact me (xi.wang3@anu.ed.au) if you use them. I am interested in how you use the data and if you find any issues. Even if everything seems to work fine, I'd still be interested in hearing from you.
