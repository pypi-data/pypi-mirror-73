Description: patchelf-wrapper
        ================
        
        **patchelf-wrapper** is a simple Python module that assists in the
        installation of the `*patchelf* <https://nixos.org/patchelf.html>`__
        utility. It's intended for use with PyPI-hosted Python projects that
        depend on patchelf. If you're an end-user of patchelf, you should look
        elsewhere! (Perhaps your OS's package manager?)
        
        Currently, patchelf-wrapper installs **patchelf 0.11**.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Ordinarily, you'll just want to set ``'patchelf-wrapper'`` as one of
        your requirements (e.g. in ``setup.py``). If installing directly, you
        can just use ``python setup.py install`` or ``python setup.py build`` as
        usual; this respects all the usual options, including automatically
        installing patchelf into the ``bin`` dir of a virtualenv if one is
        active.
        
        In addition, patchelf-wrapper contains the following setup commands
        beyond the defaults:
        
        -  ``check_patchelf``: Checks if patchelf is already installed on the
           system
        -  ``build_patchelf``: Extract patchelf's source and build it
        -  ``install_patchelf``: Install patchelf to the chosen location
