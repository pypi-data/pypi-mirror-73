Description: # stringine
        A simple cross-platform string manipulation utility
        
        ## Whatâ€™s Stringine?
        
        Weâ€™re aiming to build a string library available for as many languages as possible, with as similar functionality as possible for all platforms.
        
        Stringineâ€™s functionality ranges from light functions (such as string capitalization and reversing) to more advanced functions (such as translating strings with character maps).
        The reason why we have lighter features that a developer could implement themselves is being all-in-one: a developer only has to use Stringine and no other modules or implementations to achieve even the simplest functionality in their application!
        
        A developer can also easily move the exact same line of code to another language and achieve the same result: thatâ€™s what Stringine is all about.
        
        ## Collaborate
        
        Stringine is currently under development and thereâ€™s still a lot to be done!
        If you want to help, you are welcome to contribute.
