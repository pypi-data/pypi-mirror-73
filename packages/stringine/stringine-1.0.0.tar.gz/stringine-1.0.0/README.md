# stringine
A simple cross-platform string manipulation utility

## What’s Stringine?

We’re aiming to build a string library available for as many languages as possible, with as similar functionality as possible for all platforms.

Stringine’s functionality ranges from light functions (such as string capitalization and reversing) to more advanced functions (such as translating strings with character maps).
The reason why we have lighter features that a developer could implement themselves is being all-in-one: a developer only has to use Stringine and no other modules or implementations to achieve even the simplest functionality in their application!

A developer can also easily move the exact same line of code to another language and achieve the same result: that’s what Stringine is all about.

## Collaborate

Stringine is currently under development and there’s still a lot to be done!
