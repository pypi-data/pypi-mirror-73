Welcome to Git Gud, a command line game designed to help you learn how to use the popular version control system known as Git!

To play the game, remember these important commands:

#1) git gud instructions: Displays instructions for the current level - if you're unsure what to do next, use this!
#2) git gud goal: Shows the precise goal to complete for the current level.
#3) git gud commit: git gud automates the commit process for you to simplify things (you'll learn about commits first)
#4) git gud test: Once you've completed the current level's goals, use this to check completion.
#5) git gud progress: Whether you've completed the current level or just want to skip it, use this to proceed to the next level!
