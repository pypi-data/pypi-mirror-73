This is a practice level to get you started with the format of "git gud".
Hit enter to advance.
>>>
You are currently reading the instructions. As long as you see the ">>>", you are reading the instructions.
 You won't be able to enter any commands until you're done reading the instructions.
>>>
As you progress, "git gud" will guide you through the relevant commands in both "git" and "git gud".
>>>
The first command we'll introduce you to is "git gud commit".
 "git gud commit" is a special command that does does three things.
  1) It creates a new file
  2) It adds that file to git
  3) It commits the new file
 Whenever git gud does something for you, it will let you know what actions/commands it is simulating.
>>>
Now look below. Since there's no more ">>>", we're back in the normal command line, and you can type in commands again.

To complete this level, commit twice using "git gud commit"
When you're done, run "git gud test" to see if you've completed this level.
