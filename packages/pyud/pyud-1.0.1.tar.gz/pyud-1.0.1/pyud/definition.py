class Definition:
    """
    Represents an Urban Dictionary definition

    This class is not intended to be instantiated directly.
    It is preferably obtained using either one
    of :class:`Client` or :class:`AsyncClient`, and using one
    of the defined API wrapper methods/coroutines to retrieve definitions
    from the API.

    .. note::

        Any additional attributes that may be provided in the future by the API
        are also added to the instance, but they are provided as is,
        and are not processed in any way. Future versions may be support
        any added attributes.

    .. note::

        The :attr:`current_vote` attribute is not included
        as a required attribute, as it does not contain any meaningful information.

    .. attribute:: defid

        The ID of the definition

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: word

        The term being defined

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: definition

        The definition description

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: author

        The author of the definition

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: thumbs_up

        The number of upvotes on the definition

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: thumbs_down

        The number of downvotes on the definition

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: example

        An example usage of the term

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: permalink

        A permalink to the definition

        :type: str

    .. attribute:: written_on

        The date that the definition was written
