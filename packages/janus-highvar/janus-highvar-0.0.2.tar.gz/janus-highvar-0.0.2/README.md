Janus provides Wyrmwood High Variance [dice](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wyrmwood/dice-by-wyrmwood) dice roller functions. These dice maintain the same average roll as "standard" Dungeons and Dragons dice, but they have individual values skewed towards higher or lower rolls. Janus utilizes a random selector to roll the dice.

These dice are intended for "do or die" situations, where the party will either succeed or fail in heroic fashion.

In order to use the functions:
