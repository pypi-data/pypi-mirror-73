##OTPLIB
The otp library is a simple library to send otp to a email. It is already equiped with an email id to send with , but you can use your own 
mail id also.

##Installation
1) To install the otplib package on windows  


    pip install otplib

2) To install otplib on mac/linux running python3   


    pip3 install otplib

3) To install otplib on mac/linux running python2  


    pip install otplib

Even though this would work , i would recommend you to use --user.

##Usage
different functions in the module  
1) send_otp()  - takes one argument(the mail of the person you are sending)  
2) resend_otp() - takes no argument , use this only if you have used the send_otp function to send the otp to the person the first time  
3) get_otp() - takes no argument use this to print the otp that has been generated  
4) custom_otp() - takes one argument (the otp which you want to send), use this if you want to send your own otp  
5) resend_custom_otp() - takes no argument , use this only if you have used the custom_otp function to send the otp to the person the first time  
6) custom_mail() - takes three arguments (your mail id , your password for mail id ,otp(type "OTP" if you want to use the randomly generated  
                   otp) use this function if you want to use your own mail to send the otp
7) resend_custom_mail() - takes no argument , use this only if you have used the custom_mail function to send the otp to the person the first time  

##Note
1) When using the predefined mail id for sending otp 
the coder of the library that's me is having access to that mail but promises that he will not use it , if you do not trust him ,
you can use the custom_mail(),resend_custom_mail() command which uses the mail provided by you to send the otp to your client
i am not sure if you can create an mail account for sending otp , if you can please mail me the methods to do it at marisonsanjay@gmail.com

2) When sending otp using custom mail
if you want to use the already generated otp to send the mail , just give the fourth argument of the function as "OTP"
