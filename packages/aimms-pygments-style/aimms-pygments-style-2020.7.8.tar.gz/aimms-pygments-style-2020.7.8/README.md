# AIMMS Pygments Style

Enable a style in Pygments Python package for highlighting AIMMS code. Notably, this can be coupled with a proper AIMMS lexer, and Sphinx Python documentation generator. 

Install
-----------

`python -m pip install aimms-pygments-style`

Verify it is working
---------------------

Please run the following commands in the Python Interpreter:

``` python
    >>> from pygments.styles import get_all_styles
    >>> list(get_all_styles())
```

And verify that you have a new Pygments style named `aimmslexer`

Using it in your Sphinx latex output
--------------------------------------

To use this freshly installed Pygment style, you finally need to add the following line to your conf.py file:

``` python
# The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.
pygments_style = 'aimmslexer'

```

Modifying style rules
----------------------

To modify it, please take a look at the file [aimmslexer.py](https://gitlab.com/ArthurdHerbemont/aimms-pygments-style/tree/master/style) and [Pygments Style documentation](http://pygments.org/docs/styles/)
