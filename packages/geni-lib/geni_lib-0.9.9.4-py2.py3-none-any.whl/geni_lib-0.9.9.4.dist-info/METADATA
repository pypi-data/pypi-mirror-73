geni-lib is a Python library for interacting with the `NSF GENI Federation <http://www.geni.net>`_,
or any resource pool that uses components of the `GENI Software Architecture <http://groups.geni.net/geni/raw-attachment/wiki/GeniArchitectTeam/GENI%20Software%20Architecture%20v1.0.pdf>`_.

Common uses include orchestrating repeatable experiments and writing small tools for
inspecting the resources available in a given federation.  There are also a number
of administrative API handlers available for interacting with software commonly used
in experiments - particularly those exposing services to other experimenters.
