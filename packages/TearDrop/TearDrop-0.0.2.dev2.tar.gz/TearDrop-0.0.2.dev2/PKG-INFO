Description: # TearDrop
        
        TearDrop project contains many useful various machine learning algorithms and models. You can
        find there anything from Linear regression, KNN, SVMs up to deep learning and LSTMs. 
        
        ## Installation
        Installing from pypi using `pip`:
        ```
        pip install teardrop
        # or you can do this
        python3 -m pip install teardrop
        ```
        You can also install it directly from our [repository](https://gitlab.com/dec0ded/teardrop):
        ```
        pip install git+https://gitlab.com/dec0ded/teardrop
        ```
        
        ## Example code
        Using TearDrop you can easily create many various neural nets, e.g. Dense neural network.
        ```python
        from teardrop.layers.core import Dense
        from teardrop.neural_models import Sequential
        
        net = Sequential(loss='mse', optimizer='sgd')
        net.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=5))
        net.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
        ```
        And voila! We've created a basic network which is able to take inputs with shape `(N, 5)`
        and returns output with shape `(N, 1)`.
