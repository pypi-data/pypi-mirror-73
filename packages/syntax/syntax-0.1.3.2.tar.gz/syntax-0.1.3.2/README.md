When to use:

- want to conveniently map long sequences and want to avoid `[x for x in ...]` or `map`
- frustrated about doing simple, but rare things that could've been done better
- want to emulate features from other languages

When not to use:

- want to maintain purity of code
- speed is of concern
- want to keep it simple
