3.0.1
---------------------------------

Compatibility with mercurials ≥ 5.0 (which introduced API changes
which caused cvs2hg crashes).

This cvs2hg version is formally testes against Mercurials
from 3.2 to 5.4 (inclusive).

Mercurial versions ≤ 3.1 aren't supported.


3.0.0
--------------------------------

General cleanup from non-cvs2hg related parts, renaming to cvs2hg,
dropping various irrelevant or non-maintained doc parts, tests
partially cleaned up and partially removed to be used against
Mercurial only. Setup.py updated to properly package or install
the tool. All modules and scripts which could conflict with 
cvs2svn renamed.

PyPI release.
