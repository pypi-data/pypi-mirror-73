                        REPORTING BUGS
                        ==============

Please report bugs to HeptaPod issue tracker:

    https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-cvs2hg

Before reporting a bug:

   a) Verify that you are running the latest version of cvs2hg.

   b) Check to see if your bug is already filed in the issue tracker.

To be useful, a bug report should include the following information:

   * The revisions of cvs2hg and hg you ran. Run `cvs2hg --version`
     and `hg --version` to determine those.

   * The exact cvs2hg command line you invoked, and the output it
     produced.

   * The contents of the configuration file that you used (if you used
     the --config option).

   * The data you ran it on.  If your CVS repository is small (only a
     few kilobytes), then just provide the repository itself.  If it's
     large, or if the data is confidential, then please try to come up
     with some smaller, releasable data set that still stimulates the
     bug.

The most important thing is that we be able to reproduce the bug :-).
If we can reproduce it, we can usually fix it.  If we can't reproduce
it, we'll probably never fix it.  So describing the bug conditions
accurately is crucial.  If in addition to that, you want to add some
speculations as to the cause of the bug, or even include a patch to
fix it, that's great!
