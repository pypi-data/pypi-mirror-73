## üôå Support Me

I'm keeping SpellBot running using my own money but if you like the bot and want
to help me out, please consider donating to [my ko-fi][ko-fi].

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing

If you'd like to become a part of the SpellBot development community please
first know that we have a documented [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and
then see our [documentation on how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details
on how to get started.

## üîß Running SpellBot Yourself

First install `spellbot` using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```shell
pip install spellbot
```

Provide your Discord bot token with the environment variable `SPELLBOT_TOKEN`.
As well as your SpellTable API authorization token via `SPELLTABLE_AUTH`. You
can get [your bot token from Discord][discord-bot-docs]. As for the SpellTable
API authorization token, you'll have to talk to the SpellTable developers.
You can join their Discord server by
[becoming a SpellTable patron][spelltable-patron].

By default SpellBot will use sqlite3 as its database. You can however choose to
use another database by providing a [SQLAlchemy Connection URL][db-url]. This
can be done via the `--database-url` command line option or the environment
variable `SPELLBOT_DB_URL`. Note that, at the time of this writing, SpellBot is
only tested against sqlite3 and PostgreSQL.

More usage help can be found by running `spellbot --help`.

## üê≥ Docker Support

You can also run SpellBot via docker. See
[our documentation on Docker Support](DOCKER.md) for help.
