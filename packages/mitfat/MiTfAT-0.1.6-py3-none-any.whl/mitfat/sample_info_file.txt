## This is a template for input files for the MiTfAT library,
#  				a pyhton-based fMRI analysis tool.
# In which line you write the info is irrelevant.
# every line not starting with a valid keyword is ignored.
# There should be at least one blank space between the keyword and the following input values.
# The only obligatory keywords are the DATA_FILE and MASK_FILE.
# The rest will be assigned default values or just ignored if not defined.

# REQUIRED keywords are:
# 'DATA_FILE:' -> (REQUIRED) name of the nifty data files
# 'MASK_FILE:' -> (REQUIRED) nifty file including the mask file.
                   0 elements in this file means ignore the voxel, non-zero means read the voxel.

# OPTIONAL Keywords:
# 'TIME_FILE:' -> file including time points for each data point.
                  If left blank, indices of data points are used as time-steps, starting from 1.
# 'EVENT_TIMES' -> can be any events of interest.
                    should be numbers (float or integer), comma separated.
                    They'd be irrelevant if TIME_FILE does not exist.
                    They do not need to match exact values of time steps.
# 'DIR_SOURCE:' -> Absolute or relative path to source directory.
                   default is 'datasets' subfolder inside the folder in which this file exists.
# 'DIR_SAVE:' -> Absolute or relative path to directory used to save the outputs.
                default is used: 'output' subfolder inside the current python folder,
		(not necessarily folder containing this file).
# 'MOL_NAME:' -> Molecule name. Used in molecular fMRI experiments.
                 If not left blank will be used to establish DIR_SAVE name.
# 'EXP_NAME:' -> Experiment name.
                 If not left blank will be used to establish DIR_SAVE name.
# 'DESC:'-> A free style text with info about the dataset.
# 'DS_NO:' -> An integer number assigned to identify the dataset.
             If not left blank will be used to establish DIR_SAVE name.
# 'SIGNAL_NAME:' -> can be T1w, FISP, T2* or any arbitrary string.

## Here is a sample info file:
# obligatiry info:
DATA_FILE: sample_data_T1w.nii.gz
MASK_FILE: sample_data_mask.nii.gz

# optional time file, and event times
TIME_FILE: sample_data_time_T1w.txt
EVENT_TIMES: 123,181

# other optional info
MOL_NAME: SCA
SIGNAL_NAME: T1w
DS_NO: 1
EXP_NAME: Exp1
DESC: Just a sample dataset.
