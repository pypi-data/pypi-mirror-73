Description: StarCoder is essentially a generator that combines autoencoder and graph-convolutional mechanisms with the open set of neural architectures to build end-to-end models of entity-relationship schemas.  By adopting intuitive JSON for all I/O, and using reconstruction loss as the objective, it allows researchers from other fields to apply it to their specific areas, while ML researchers can continue to augment it with new techniques.
