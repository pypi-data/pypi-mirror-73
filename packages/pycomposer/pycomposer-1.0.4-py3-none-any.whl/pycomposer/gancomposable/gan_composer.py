class GANComposer(GANComposable):
    '''
    Algorithmic Composer based on Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs).

    This composer learns observed data points drawn from a true distribution 
    of input MIDI files and generates feature points drawn from a fake distribution 
    that means such as Uniform distribution or Normal distribution, imitating the true MIDI 
    files data.

    The components included in this class are functionally differentiated into three models.

    1. `TrueSampler`.
    2. `Generator`.
    3. `Discriminator`.

    The function of `TrueSampler` is to draw samples from a true distribution of input MIDI files. 
    `Generator` has `NoiseSampler`s and draw fake samples from a Uniform distribution or Normal 
    distribution by use it. And `Discriminator` observes those input samples, trying discriminating 
    true and fake data. 

    While `Discriminator` observes `Generator`'s observation to discrimine the output from true samples, 
    `Generator` observes `Discriminator`'s observations to confuse `Discriminator`s judgments. 
    In GANs framework, the mini-max game can be configured by the observations of observations.

    After this game, the `Generator` will grow into a functional equivalent that enables to imitate 
    the `TrueSampler` and makes it possible to compose similar but slightly different music by the 
    imitation.

    In this class, Long short term memory(LSTM) networks are implemented as `Generator` and `Discriminator`.
    Originally, Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) networks as a special RNN structure has proven stable and 
    powerful for modeling long-range dependencies.
    
    The Key point of structural expansion is its memory cell which essentially acts as an accumulator of the state information. 
    Every time observed data points are given as new information and input to LSTM's input gate, its information will be accumulated to 
    the cell if the input gate is activated. The past state of cell could be forgotten in this process if LSTM's forget gate is on.
    Whether the latest cell output will be propagated to the final state is further controlled by the output gate.

    Following MidiNet and MuseGAN(Dong, H. W., et al., 2018), this class consider bars
    as the basic compositional unit for the fact that harmonic changes usually occur at 
    the boundaries of bars and that human beings often use bars as the building blocks 
    when composing songs. The feature engineering in this class also is inspired by 
    the Multi-track piano-roll representations in MuseGAN. But their strategies of 
    activation function did not apply to this library since its methods can cause 
    information losses. The models just binarize the `Generator`'s output, which 
    uses tanh as an activation function in the output layer, by a threshold at zero, 
    or by deterministic or stochastic binary neurons(Bengio, Y., et al., 2018, Chung, J., et al., 2016), 
    and ignore drawing a distinction the consonance and the dissonance.

    This library simply uses the softmax strategy. This class stochastically selects 
    a combination of pitches in each bars drawn by the true MIDI files data, based on 
    the difference between consonance and dissonance intended by the composer of the MIDI files.
