        Returns matching items from the data store; and stats, if requested.

        Args:
            query_terms (nark.managers.query_terms.QueryTerms, required):
                The QueryTerms object defines the query settings used to find
                matching items, and it also defines how the results should be
                packaged. See the QueryTerms class for details.

        Returns:
            list: A list of matching item instances or (item, *statistics) tuples.
            - If raw results are requested, each item is the Alchemy<Item> object
              from SQLAlchemy (e.g., nark.backends.sqlalchemy.objects.AlchemyActivity).
              Otherwise, by default, each item is a first-class <Item> instance,
              hydrated from the Alchemy object (e.g., nark.items.activity.Activity).
            - If include_stats is requested, each result is a tuple consisting of
              the item as the first element, followed by additional calculated
              values (aggregates) pertaining to the query.
            - The list of results will be ordered according to the QueryTerms
              sort_cols and sort_orders options, if possible. Otherwise, for
              some queries that concatenate and post-process a value that is to
              be sorted on, the sorting is left as an exercise for the caller
              (because often the caller must do some post-processing of its own,
              so this method does not waste the cycles using, say, a subquery to
              do the sort in an outer query).
