# When committing a change script, Migrate will attempt to generate the
# sql for all supported databases; normally, if one of them fails - probably
# because you don't have that database installed - it is ignored and the
# commit continues, perhaps ending successfully.
# Databases in this list MUST compile successfully during a commit, or the
# entire commit will fail. List the databases your application will actually
# be using to ensure your updates to that database work properly.
# This must be a list; example: ['postgres','sqlite']

# When creating new change scripts, Migrate will stamp the new script with
# a version number. By default this is latest_version + 1. You can set this
# to 'true' to tell Migrate to use the UTC timestamp instead.
