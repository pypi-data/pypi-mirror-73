    """Application-specific AppDirs interface.

    Note: This class is a Singleton, because its data is immutable, and it
    represents global data (that's generated from the user name and
    application details) that goes unchanged throughout the application
    lifetime. *So it's appropriate and defensible to declare this class
    as a Singleton (ALIMHO, -lb).*

    (lb): One Pythonic alternate, if you're anti the Singleton pattern, is to
    do away with the class and just have this be a simple module, i.e., expose
    user_data_dir(), etc., as module-scope functions. But that's not really
    that different, and then you end up with module-scope semi-global variables,
    anyway. And the user has to explicitly import each method, rather than just
    the class. It feels more simple, readable, and maintainable to encapsulate
    the methods in a class, and to make that class a singleton; half a dozen of
    one six of the other, if you ask me.

    For a good discussion on ways to implement Singleton in Python, and whether
    or not they're a good idea, read the classic *Creating a singleton in Python*:
