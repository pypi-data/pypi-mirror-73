# (lb): Note that textwrap/ansiwrap.shorten only truncates on whitespace or hyphens,
# so the actual truncated (shortened) text will not be exactly trunc_width, but will
# instead be *at most* trunc_width.
# - We could alternatively chop exactly at trunc_width, e.g.,
#     val = val[:trunc_width - len(ellipsis)] + ellipsis
#   which would truncate inside words, e.g., "it would trunca...".
#   But this approach only works on ANSI-free text, and we want this function to work
#   with ANSI-encoded (e.g., colorful) output text. So we use the shorten function.
# Note, too, that regardless of trunc_width, this function *always* replaces each
# newline with its escape sequence ("\n"), because it assumes, if it's being called,
# that the caller wants to at least condense the output (fit it all on one line).
