#         See: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PortingToPy3k/BilingualQuickRef#gettext
#         [FIXME]
#         Is this correct?
#           http://www.wefearchange.org/2012/06/the-right-way-to-internationalize-your.html
#         seems to use ``sys.version_info.major > 3``
#
# 2020-01-16: Now that Python2 (and six and future) dropped,
#  this branch not executed.
#
# FIXME/2020-01-16: (lb): EXPLAIN: Is gettext.install still necessary?
#  I.e., was this call just in case kwargs['unicode'] got set?
#
#  - Here's the old (v2-compatible) code:
#
#       kwargs = {}
#       if sys.version_info.major < 3:
#           kwargs['unicode'] = True
#       gettext.install('nark', **kwargs)
#
gettext.install('nark')

    All mandatory config options are set as part of the controller setup.
    Any client may overwrite those values. but we can always asume that the

    We will try hard to get through with at least always returning the object.
    We should be able to change only the internal service code to then
    decompose it into its required weired format.

    We were compelled to make attach CRUD-methods to our activity, category
    and fact objects. But as all of those depend on access to the store
    anyway they seem to be best be placed here as a central hub.

    Generic CRUD-actions is to be delegated to our store. The Controller itself
    provides general timetracking functions so that our clients do not have to.
