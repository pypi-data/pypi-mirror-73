        # to handle momentaneous Facts, so we have 3 ref_time comparisons, not 1.
        # - Note that I originally had an if-else block here: if fact is None,
        #   the code would simply check AlchemyFact.end <= ref_time. The use
        #   case here would be passing a datetime to this method, antecedent,
        #   and not a Fact. For example, if you had a Fact from 11a to 12p,
        #   and a Fact from 12p to 12p, passing a datetime set to 12p would
        #   return whichever of those two Facts has the greater PK (because
        #   of the query_order_by_start later in this method). If that Fact
        #   was the momentaneous Fact, you wouldn't be able to call antecedent
        #   again to get the earlier Fact given the datetime alone -- each time
        #   you pass 12p to this method, you'd get the same Fact. But that's not
        #   how this method would be used -- to handle momentaneous Facts, we
        #   need the Fact object, because we need to compare PKs. So rather
        #   than return a momentaneous Fact when a datetime is passed, skip
        #   them. That is, in the example just given, if given a datetime at
        #   12p, always return the Fact from 11a to 12p. We do this by not
        #   just searching AlchemyFact.end <= ref_time, but instead by using
        #   two search criteria, and checking both AlchemyFact.end < ref_time,
        #   or AlchemyFact.end == ref_time and AlchemyFact.start < ref_time.

        # Fact is momentaneous from 12:00:00 to 12:00:00. If user is viewing
        # a third Fact that spans from 12:00:00 to 13:00:00, antecedent
        # should return the momentaneous Fact. If antecedent is called
        # again on the momentaneous Fact, return the one that starts at 11a.
