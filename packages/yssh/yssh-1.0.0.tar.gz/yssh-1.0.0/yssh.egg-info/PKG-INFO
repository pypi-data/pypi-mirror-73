        It's a screwdriver, not a set of tools you have to learn about. 
        
        what it can do :
        
        0. reduce interactive requirement by providing answers and passwords
        1. run command remotely in specified parallel level
        2. ship and run script(or a dir including the target script) remotely in specified parallel level
        4. interactive (no parallel) in case you still need to log onto each of them
