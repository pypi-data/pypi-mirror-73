Description: # Agoge
        
        An opinionated ML development environment
        
        Train pytorch models, hyperparameter tune them with single loc change.
        
        
        ## Libraries
        
        ### Pytorch
        
        [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a Python first machine learning library 
        
        ### Ray
        
        [Ray](https://ray-project.github.io/) Provides easy experiment scaling + hyper parameter optimisation
        
        ### Weights and Biases
        
        Agoge uses WandB to monitor model training. It's super easy to setup, just go to the [wandb website](https://www.wandb.com/) and sign up for an account. Then follow the instructions to set up
        
        ## Static Components
        
        These components should not need to be customised for model specific use cases
        
        ### Train Worker
        
        Setups all the required components to train a model
        
        ### Inference Worker
        
        Setups all the required components for inference. Also attempts to download model weights if they are not found locally.
        
        ### Data Handler
        
        Loads the dataset and handles the dataset split
        
        ## User Provided Components
        
        These components need to be inherited by project specific classes
        
        ### Model
        
        Provides some convenience functions around loading models. This class will hold all model specific code and is used by the train worker and inference workers
        
        ### Solver
        
        Override the `solve` method with the code required to train your model
        
        ### Dataset
        
        Any dataset that is compatiable with the [Pytorch map style dataset model](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#map-style-datasets)
        
        
        # Disclaimer
        
        This code is subject to change. I will try not to break anything but can't promise. File an issue if an update breaks your code
