Description: Simple AWS Lambda Maker
        =======================
        
        This is a super simple tool for creating/modifying multiple lambda functions.
        
        It was built for the purpose of deploying our Alexa skills across multiple
        regions in the same account.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just use pip::
        
          $ pip install simple-aws-lambda-maker
        
        Then create a ``salm.yml`` with something like:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
          ---
        
          function_defaults:
            filepath: "{config_root}/lambda_function.py"
            runtime: "python2.7"
            role: "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/lambda_basic_execution"
            timeout: 8
            handler: "lambda_function.lambda_handler"
        
          functions:
            prod:
              - name: test
                region: us-east-1
                description: "Test function"
                env:
                  ONE: "1"
                  TWO: "2"
                tags:
                  three: "four"
        
              - name: test2
                region: us-east-1
                description: "Test function 2"
                env:
                  ONE: "3"
                  TWO: "4"
                tags:
                  three: "four"
        
            staging:
              - name: test3
                region: us-east-1
                description: "Test function 2"
                env:
                  ONE: "5"
                  TWO: "6"
                tags:
                  three: "four"
        
        Here we are creating three functions, called test, test2 and test3.
        
        They are all put into ``us-east-1`` and have different values for the ``ONE``
        and ``TWO`` environment variables.
        
        All of them also have the options in the ``function_defaults`` block, which
        includes a reference to a file relative to this file called ``./lambda_function.py``
        
        For example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          import os
          def lambda_handler(event, context):
              return "{0} - {1}".format(os.environ["ONE"], os.environ["TWO"])
        
        We can then determine if anything will be created or changed by going into that
        directory and saying::
        
          $ salm deploy staging --dry-run
        
        And then to actually apply those changes::
        
          $ salm deploy staging
        
        And to do the prod group, do a ``salm deploy prod``
