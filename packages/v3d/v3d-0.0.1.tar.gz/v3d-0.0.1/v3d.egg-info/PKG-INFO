Description: # v3d
        v3d (Stands for Vector 3D) is a 3D vector library for basic Vector operations.
        It was inspired by: https://github.com/allelos/vectors
        
        ## WHY
        Why I created this work?
        The work done https://github.com/allelos/vectors was good. However some of functions was not there yet (such as from_mag_and_dir).
        In the other hand I needed the module with logging ability. So I added it.
        
        ## Installation
        
        It is not pip installable. However will be soon.
