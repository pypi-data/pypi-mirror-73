Description: pyiCn3D
        =======
        
        A simple [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) widget to
        embed an interactive [iCn3D](https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d) viewer in a notebook.
        
        The widget is completely static, which means the viewer doesn't need a running
        IPython kernel to be useful and web pages and presentations generated from
        the notebook will work as expected.  However, this also means there is only
        one-way communication between the notebook and the viewer.
        
        If you experience problems, please file 
        an [issue](https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d/issues).
        
        
        [An example notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/3dmol/3Dmol.js/blob/master/py3Dmol/examples.ipynb)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From PyPI:
        
            pip install pyiCn3D
        
        
        *Important:* In order to use with JupyterLab you must install the JupyterLab extension:
        
            jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_3dmol
        
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Open a notebook
        
            jupyter notebook
        
        and issue
        
        ```Python
        import pyiCn3D
        view = pyiCn3D.view(query='mmdbid:1kq2')
        view
        ```
        
        Command
        ---
        
        All [iCn3D commands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/icn3d/icn3d.html#commands) work.
