Description: InferPy: Deep Probabilistic Modeling Made Easy
        ==============================================
        
        
        InferPy is a high-level API for deep probabilistic modeling written in Python and
        capable of running on top of Tensorflow. InferPy\'s API is strongly inspired by Keras and it has 
        a focus on enabling flexible data processing, 
        easy-to-code probabilistic modeling, scalable inference, and robust model validation.
        
        Use InferPy if you need a probabilistic programming language that:
        
        * Allows easy and fast prototyping of hierarchical probabilistic models with a simple and user-friendly
         API inspired by Keras. 
        * Automatically creates computational efficient batched models without the need to deal with complex
         tensor operations
        and theoretical concepts.
        * Run seamlessly on CPU and GPU by relying on Tensorflow, without having to learn how to use Tensorflow.
        * Defines probabilistic models with complex probabilistic constructs containing deep neural networks.
        
        
        InferPy is to Edward what Keras is to Tensorflow
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        InferPy\'s aim is to be to Edward what Keras is to Tensorflow. Edward is
        a general purpose probabilistic programing language, like Tensorflow is
        a general computational engine. But this generality comes a at price.
        Edward\'s API is verbose and is based on distributions over Tensor
        objects, which are n-dimensional arrays with complex semantics
        operations. Probability distributions over Tensors are powerful
        abstractions but it is not easy to operate with them. InferPy\'s API is
        no so general like Edward\'s API but still covers a wide range of
        powerful and widely used probabilistic models, which can contain complex
        probability constructs containing deep neural networks.
