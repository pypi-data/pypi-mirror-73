DEWI commands: A lot of command for different purposes
======================================================

Name
----
DEWI: Old Welsh form of David

The name is chosen because of the similarity to DWA, which was the project's
original name, which stands for Developer's Work Area.


Purpose
-------

A set of collected commands which I use more or less.

Installation
------------

It can be installed from source::

        python3 setup.py

Or from pip::

        pip install dewi_commands
