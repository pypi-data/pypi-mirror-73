Description: # gcloud-tail
        
        The `gcloud` CLI provides a way to "tail" logs from Google App Engine, but not from Stackdriver.  Which is
        odd, because it's not especially difficult to do so.  That's what this utility accomplishes.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Run this as `gcloud-tail FILTER`.  The result is in JSON format, with one line per log message.
        You can process the results with `jq`.  For example:
        
        ```shell
        $ gcloud-tail 'severity>=ERROR' | jq -r .textPayload
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        This is a simple Python distribution.  The easiest way to install is
        
        ```shell
        pip install gcloud-tail
        ```
