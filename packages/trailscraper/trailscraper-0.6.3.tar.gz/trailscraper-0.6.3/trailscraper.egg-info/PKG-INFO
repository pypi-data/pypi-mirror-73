        Extend existing policy by guessing matching actions
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        CloudTrail logs might not always contain all relevant actions. For
        example, your logs might only contain the ``Create`` actions after a
        terraform run when you really want the delete and update permissions as
        well. TrailScraper can try to guess additional statements that might be
        relevant:
        
        ::
        
            $ cat minimal-policy.json | trailscraper guess
            {
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Action": [
                            "s3:PutObject"
                        ],
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Resource": [
                            "*"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Action": [
                            "s3:DeleteObject",
                            "s3:GetObject",
                            "s3:ListObjects"
                        ],
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Resource": [

                        ]

                ],

                            "s3:PutObject"

        FAQ
        ---
        
        How can I generate policies in CloudFormation YAML instead of JSON?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        TrailScraper doesn’t provide this. But you can use
        `cfn-flip <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cfn-template-flip>`__ to do
        it:
        
        ::
        
            $ trailscraper select | trailscraper generate | cfn-flip
            Statement:
              - Action:
                  - ec2:DescribeInstances
                Effect: Allow
                Resource:
                  - '*'
        
        How can I generate policies in Terraform HCL instead of JSON?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        TrailScraper doesn’t provide this. But you can use
        `iam-policy-json-to-terraform <https://github.com/flosell/iam-policy-json-to-terraform>`__
        to do it:
        
        ::
        
            $ trailscraper select | trailscraper generate | iam-policy-json-to-terraform
            data "aws_iam_policy_document" "policy" {
              statement {
                sid       = ""
                effect    = "Allow"
                resources = ["*"]
        
                actions = [
                  "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                ]
              }
            }
        
        Why is TrailScraper missing some events?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Make sure you have logs for the ``us-east-1`` region. Some global AWS
           services (e.g. Route53, IAM, STS, CloudFront) use this region. For
           details, check the `CloudTrail
           Documentation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html#cloudtrail-concepts-global-service-events>`__
        
        Why are some TrailScraper-generated actions not real IAM actions?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This is totally possible. Unfortunately, there is no good,
        machine-readable documentation on how CloudTrail events map to IAM
        actions so TrailScraper is using heuristics to figure out the right
        actions. These heuristics likely don’t cover all special cases of the
        AWS world.
        
        This is where you come in: If you find a special case that’s not covered
        by TrailScraper, please `open a new
        issue <https://github.com/flosell/trailscraper/issues/new>`__ or, even
        better, submit a pull request.
        
        For more details, check out the `contribution
        guide <./CONTRIBUTING.md>`__
        
        Why does click think I am in an ASCII environment?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment.``
        
        Set environment variables that describe your locale, e.g. :
        
        ::
        
            export LC_ALL=de_DE.utf-8
            export LANG=de_DE.utf-8
        
        or
        
        ::
        
            LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
            LANG=C.UTF-8

        **Breaking CLI changes**: split up ``generate-policy`` into ``select``
        and ``generate`` (#38)
        
        .. added-2:

        -  New command ``select`` to print all CloudTrail records matching a
           filter to stdout
        -  New command ``generate`` to take CloudTrail records from stdin and
           generate a policy for it
        
        .. changed-1:
        
        Changed
        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  New command ``select`` defaults to not filtering at all whereas
           ``generate-policy`` filtered for recent events by default. Changed to
           make filtering more explicit and predictable instead of surprising
           users who wonder why their events don’t show up
        
        .. removed-1:

        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  Removed command ``generate-policy``, replaced with ``select`` and
           ``generate``. Use pipes to produce the same behavior:
        
           .. code:: bash
        
               $ trailscraper select | trailscraper generate

        Fixed
        ~~~~~
        
        -  Made trailscraper timezone-aware. Until now, trailscraper implicitly
           treated everything as UTC, meaning relative timestamps (e.g. ``now``,
           ``two hours ago``) didn’t work properly when filtering logfiles to
           download or records to generate from. (#39)
        
        .. added-3:
        
        Added
        ~~~~~
        
        -  New command ``trailscraper last-event-timestamp`` to get the last
           known event timestamp.
        -  New flag ``trailscraper download --wait`` to wait until events for
           the specified timeframe are found. Useful if you are waiting for
           CloudTrail to ship logs for a recent operation.

        -  Fixed various special cases in mapping CloudTrail to IAM Actions:
        
           -  API Gateway
           -  App Stream 2
           -  DynamoDB Streams
           -  Lex
           -  Mechanical Turk
           -  S3
           -  STS
           -  Tagging

        .. fixed-5:
        
        Fixed
        ~~~~~
        
        -  Ignore record files that can’t be read (e.g. not valid GZIP) in
           Python 2.7 (was only working in Python 3.\* before)
        -  Fixed permissions generated for services that include the API version
           date (e.g. Lambda, CloudFront) (#20)

        -  Support for CloudTrail ``lookup_events`` API that allows users to
           generate a policy without downloading logs from an S3 bucket. Note
           that this API only returns *`“create, modify, and delete API
           calls” <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events-supported-services.html>`__*
        -  ``trailscraper download`` now supports ``--from`` and ``--to`` flags
           to specify the timeframe that should be downloaded. Accepts precise
           (e.g. “2017-10-12”) and relative (e.g. “-2days”) arguments.
        -  ``trailscraper generate-policy`` now supports ``--from`` and ``--to``
           to filter events to consider for the generated policy. Accepts
           precise (e.g. “2017-10-12”) and relative (e.g. “-2days”) arguments.
        
        -  Performance optimizations: ``generate-policy`` only reads logfiles
           for the timeframe requested
        
        -  Added ``--version`` command line argument
        
        .. changed-2:

        -  Removed ``--past-days`` parameter in ``trailscraper download``. Was
           replaced by ``--from`` and ``--to`` (see above)

        -  Do not download CloudTrail Logs from S3 if they already exist in the
           target folder (#9)

           installation and development

        -  Basic feature to download CloudTrail Logs from S3 for certain
           accounts and timeframe
        -  Basic feature to generate IAM Policies from a set of downloaded
           CloudTrail logs
