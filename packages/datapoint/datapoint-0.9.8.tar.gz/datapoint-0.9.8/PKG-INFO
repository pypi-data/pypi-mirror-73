Description: 
        Datapoint for Python
        --------------------
        
        *A Python module for accessing weather data via the Met
        Office's open data API known as
        `Datapoint`.*
        
        **Disclaimer: This module is in no way part of the datapoint
        project/service. This module is intended to simplify the use of
        Datapoint for small Python projects (e.g school projects). No support
        for this module is provided by the Met Office and may break as the
        Datapoint service grows/evolves. The author will make reasonable efforts
        to keep it up to date and fully featured.**
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        
        + Explicitly state the use of semantic versioning in `README.md`.
        + Add `elements()` function to `Timestep`.
        + Remove night/day indication from weather codes which have them.
        + Change the logic used to calculate the closest timestep to a datetime. The closest timestep to the datetime is now used. Add a new function, `Forecast.at_datetime(target)` to do this. `Forecast.now()` has been changed to use this new function. The old behaviour is deprecated and available using `Forecast.now_old()`. `Forecast.future()` has been changed to use this new function. The old behaviour is deprecated and available using `Forecast.future_old()`.
        + Check if keys are returned from datapoint api in `Manager.py`. Do not attempt to read the values from the dict if they are not there.
