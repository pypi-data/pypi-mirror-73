# IVObject

Forked from: https://github.com/quiqueporta/simple-value-object

A value object is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality isn't based on 
identity: i.e. two value objects are equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being 
the same object.

Installation
------------

```bash 
> pip install ivobject
```
