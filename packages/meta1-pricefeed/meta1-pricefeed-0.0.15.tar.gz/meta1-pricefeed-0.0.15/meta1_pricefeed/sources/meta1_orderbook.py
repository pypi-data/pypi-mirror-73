class Meta1Orderbook(FeedSource):
    """
        This price source uses meta1 orderbooks to calculate the price. The idea is to provide price based on
        ordersbooks liquidity and depth.

        Properties used by this feed source:
        - self.mode: price calculation mode
          - "center_price": measure bids/asks depth and calculate center price. In this mode borrowers may be force
            settled at price which is higher than highest_bid. Consider setting "Force Settlement Offset" in bitasset
            settings.
          - "buy_support": measure depth of bids and calculate buy support price. In this mode borrowers are in more
            safety because force settlements will be performed at price lower than highest_bid price.
        - self.quote_volume: measure orderbook for this depth of QUOTE asset volume to calculate price. We don't use
          similar self.base_volume param because BASE asset is different across several markets, so the comparison is
          disturbed in such case.
        - self.depth_pct: measure orderbook for relative % depth, starting from closest order. This allows to estimate
          orderbook liqudity near the center price

         For example, we have a smartcoin FOO which is backed by META1, and UIAs xxx.FOO and yyy.FOO. We want to provide
         pricefeed for FOO based on orderbooks of xxx.FOO and yyy.FOO in various pairs with META1, BTC, CNY, USD and so
         on. Actually we can use orderbooks of FOO itself too.
