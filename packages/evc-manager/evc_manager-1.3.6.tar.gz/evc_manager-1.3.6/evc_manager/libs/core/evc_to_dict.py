""" Module to convert a class to a dictionary """


def convert_class(cls):
    """
        This function is used to convert the models to
        to a dictionary that can be converted to YAML later.

        This funcion works in a recursive way. So far, each
        class can have three main types:

        value: it is a class that has an int/str/dict/empty_list attribute
            meaning it is 'terminal'
        list: it is a non-empty list
        class: it is another class

        For value, it returns the attribute
        For list, it circulates the list
        For class, it uses vars to identify all attributes and calls
            the convert_class in a recursive way, until reaching
            its value

        :param: cls: class to be converted to dict
        :return: value, a list or a dict
