Description: # AmLight Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) Manager
        
        The AmLight EVC Manager is a command line tool to help SDN operators in 
        managing Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVC), such as
        creating/deleting/changing multiple EVCs at a time. It was created to
        help AmLight network engineers in the daily operation of the AmLight SDN
        network, which currently has more than one thousands flows and more than
        ten OpenFlow switches in North and South America.
        
        The AmLight EVC\_Manager requires Python 3.6+
        
        # Features
        
        The EVC Manager was created with the following major goals:
        
        >   - Supporting multiple backends, such as OESS and Kytos E-Line.
        >   - Supporting exporting EVCs to YAML or JSON files
        >   - Supporting creating/changing/deleting multiple EVCs via YAML files
        >   - Supporting moving EVCs out a specific link (or NNI)
        >   - Supporting forcing circuit reprovisioning
        >   - Supporting changing EVCs' paths
        >   - Supporting exporting monitoring data using Zabbix LLD format for
        >     integration with Zabbix
        >   - Supporting multiple queries:
        >       - Get VLANs in use in a specific UNI or NNI
        >       - Get EVCs using a specific UNI or NNI
        >       - Get EVC utilization
        >       - Get list of EVCs with under-provisioned paths
        >       - Get EVCs using backup paths
        >       - Get list of devices and links
        >       - Compare and report two EVC dumps
        
        # Current Version
        
        The current EVC Manager is 0.3. The following major features are supported:
        
        >   - Supporting for OESS 1.0.9 backend
        >   - Supporting exporting all EVCs to YAML or JSON files
        >   - Supporting creating/changing/deleting multiple EVCs via YAML files
        >   - Supporting for EVC creation using VLAN ranges
        >   - Supporting moving EVC out a specific link (or NNI)
        >   - Supporting changing EVCs' paths
        >   - Supporting multiple queries:
        >       - Get EVC using a specific UNI
        >       - Get EVC using a specific NNI
        >       - Get EVC using backup paths
        
        Version 0.4 is scheduled for March 2020 with the following features:
        
        >   - Supporting exporting monitoring data using Zabbix LLD format for
        >     integration with Zabbix
        >   - Supporting for Kytos MEF E-Line backend
        >   - Supporting forcing EVC reprovisioning
        >   - Supporting multiple queries:
        >       - Get VLANs in use in a specific UNI

        # Using the evc manager
        
        The EVC Manager should run as a Python module and installed directly from pip repository.
        Before using the EVC Manager, make sure you have Python3 and PIP for your environment. 
        Then, prepare the environment using the following steps:
        
        Create a Python virtual environment:
        
            python3 -m venv py3-evc_manager
            source py3-evc_manager/bin/activate
            
        Install git. Then, close the repo and install all requirements
        
            pip install evc_manager
        
        There are two options to run EVC Manager. As a script at the Shell or as a module in your
        application.
        
        To run EVC Manager as a script, just run using the syntax below:
        
            python3.6 -m evc_manager [-h] (-L | -A | -R | -C | -D | -M | -X)

        To use EVC_Manager as a Python module, follow these steps. The INPUT is just an example and
        represents the input you mean to submit to the evc_manager (use option -h to discover all options):
        
            from evc_manager import EvcManager, get_cli
            INPUT = ['-u', 'admin',
                 '-t', 'admin',
                 '-p', 'sparc123',
                 '-O', 'https://192.168.56.10/oess/',
                 '-v', 'info',
                 '-q',
                 '-f', './add_evcs.yaml',
                 '-A']
            evc_mgr = EvcManager(get_cli(INPUT))
            final_result = evc_mgr.run()
            print(final_result)
        
        Attention: Avoid using option --password with admin accounts. Your password might be stored 
        in your Bash history\!\!
