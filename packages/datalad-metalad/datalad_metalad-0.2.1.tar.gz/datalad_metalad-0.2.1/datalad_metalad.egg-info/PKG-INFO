        This software is a [DataLad](http://datalad.org) extension that equips DataLad
        with an alternative command suite for metadata handling (extraction, aggregation,
        reporting). It is backward-compatible with the metadata storage format in DataLad
        proper, while being substantially more performant (especially on large dataset
        hierarchies). Additionally, it provides new metadata extractors and improved
        variants of DataLad's own ones that are tuned for better performance and richer,
        JSON-LD compliant metadata reports.
        
        Command(s) currently provided by this extension
        
        - `meta-extract` -- new and improved dedicated command to run any and all of
          DataLad's metadata extractors.
        - `meta-aggregate` -- complete reimplementation of metadata aggregation, with
          stellar performance benefits, in particular on large dataset hierarchies.
        - `meta-dump` -- new command to specifically access the aggregated metadata
          present in a dataset, much faster and more predictable behavior than the
          `metadata` command in datalad-core.
        
        Additional metadata extractor implementations
        
        - `metalad_core` -- enriched variant of the `datalad_core` extractor that yields
          valid JSON-LD
        - `metalad_annex` -- refurbished variant of the `annex` extractor using the
          metalad extractor API
        - `metalad_custom` -- read pre-crafted metadata from shadow/side-care files for
          a dataset and/or any file in a dataset.
        - `metalad_runprov` -- report provenance metadata for `datalad run` records
          following the [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview) model
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Before you install this package, please make sure that you [install a recent
        version of git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install).  Afterwards,
        install the latest version of `datalad-metalad` from
        [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/datalad-metalad). It is recommended to use
        a dedicated [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io):
        
            # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
            virtualenv --system-site-packages --python=python3 ~/env/datalad
            . ~/env/datalad/bin/activate
        
            # install from PyPi
            pip install datalad_metalad
        
        
        ## Support
        
        For general information on how to use or contribute to DataLad (and this
        extension), please see the [DataLad website](http://datalad.org) or the
        [main GitHub project page](http://datalad.org). The documentation is found
        here: http://docs.datalad.org/projects/metalad
        
        All bugs, concerns and enhancement requests for this software can be submitted here:

        If you have a problem or would like to ask a question about how to use DataLad,
        please [submit a question to
        NeuroStars.org](https://neurostars.org/tags/datalad) with a ``datalad`` tag.
        NeuroStars.org is a platform similar to StackOverflow but dedicated to
        neuroinformatics.
