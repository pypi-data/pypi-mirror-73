Description: A suite of algorithms for powerful, but easy to use statistical outlier detection/rejection.
                                Especially useful for cleaning heavily (sometimes >85%) contaminated datasets,
                                while avoiding the rejection of non-outlier points.
                                Supports weighted datasets, multi-dimensional model fitting,
                                and much more. See https://github.com/nickk124/RCR for more information.
