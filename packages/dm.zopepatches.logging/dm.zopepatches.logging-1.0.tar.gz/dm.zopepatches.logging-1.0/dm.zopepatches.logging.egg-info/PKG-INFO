Description: The package provides the function ``use_zope_exception_log_format``.
        When called, it overrides ``logging.Formatter.formatException`` with
        the effect that later log entries use Zope's format for exceptions rather
        than Python's. The former contains additional hints from
        ``__traceback_info__`` and ``__traceback_supplement__`` found in the
        traceback frames.
        
        ``__traceback_info__`` and/or ``__traceback_supplement__``
        are often used by the Zope infrastructure or application code
        to provide additional information for the analysis of exception
        causes. For example, Zope's page templates use this mechanism
        to make available at what position in the template an exception occurred.
