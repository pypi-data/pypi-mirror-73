        File management utils for the curator core project.
        
        Quick start
        ===========
        
        1. Add "blob_utils" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'blob_utils',

        Tests
        =====
        
        Since GridFS cannot be mocked, this set of test has to be run on a live database. The following steps guide you through
        the process:
        
        * Setup and start a MongoDB instance
        * Set MONGODB_URI in tests/test_settings.py
        * Run the tests with :code:`python runtests.py`
