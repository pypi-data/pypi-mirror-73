Description: # webfscholar
        
        Generate publications webpage from a google scholar. This occurs in two steps:
        
        1. Generate bibtex from a google scholar
        2. Generate webpage from a bibtex
        
        The intermediate bibtex allows you to plug-and-play with other
        auto-publication-webpage services. Furthermore, unlike most Google Scholar
        unofficial APIs, this library:
        
        - Uses information pulled directly from the Google Scholar profile page, as
          opposed to un-configurable search results. This means `webfscholar` will
          respect any custom titles or removed publications.
        - Supplants Google Scholar information using ArXiv.
        
        The website-builder also supports:
        
        - A default, mobile-friendly theme with a search bar
        - Multiple bibtexs, including online sources
        
        ## Installation
