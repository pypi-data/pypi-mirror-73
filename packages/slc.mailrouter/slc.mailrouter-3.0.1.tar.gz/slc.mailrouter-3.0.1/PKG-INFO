        Introduction
        ============
        
        slc.mailrouter bridges the gap between zope and email. It is based on the same
        idea as products such as mailboxer: a script is invoked by your mail transfer
        agent (postfix, exim) and the body of the email is passed to this script on
        stdin. This is then communicated to zope using an http post, where it is parsed
        and handled.
        
        slc.mailrouter implements a component model for the handling of emails. By
        itself it allows the user to send an email to a folder and have all attachments
        on the email stored in that folder. The folder can be addressed either by
        its UID, or by assigning a friendly alias to the folder in the plone control
        panel.
        
        The MailToFolder router is implemented using an adapter pattern. If you want
        to change the way this works, Implement an adapter that adapts IFolderish
        and implements slc.mailrouter.interfaces.IMailImportAdapter. The add() method
        on this adapter receives the message as an argument and is responsible for
        persisting the contents of the message to the folder.
        
        Additional mail routes can be implemented by other products by creating a
        utility and registering it under the interface
        slc.mailrouter.interfaces.IMailRouter. Such mail router utilities are called
        one after the other until one of them reports that the message was successfully
        delivered. In this way it mirrors the way exim's routers work.
