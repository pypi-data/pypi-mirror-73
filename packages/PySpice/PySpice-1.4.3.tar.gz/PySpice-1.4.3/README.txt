Brief Notes
===========

Thanks to `Discourse <https://www.discourse.org>`_, PySpice now has a **Forum** hosted at https://pyspice.discourse.group

**Disclaimer: PySpice is developed on my free time actually, so I could be busy with other tasks and less reactive.**

An issue was found with NgSpice Shared, we must `setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C");` see https://sourceforge.net/p/ngspice/bugs/490/

Overview
========

What is PySpice ?
-----------------

PySpice is a Python module which interface |Python|_ to the |Ngspice|_ and |Xyce|_ circuit simulators.

Where is the Documentation ?
----------------------------

The documentation is available on the |PySpiceHomePage|_.

*Note: This site is hosted on my own infrastructure, if the site seems done, please create an issue to notify me.*

Where to get help or talk about PySpice ?

Pull Request Recommendation
===========================

To make it easier to merge your pull request, you should divide your PR into smaller and easier-to-verify units.

Please do not make a pull requests with a lot of modifications which are difficult to check.  **If I merge
pull requests blindly then there is a high risk this software will become a mess quickly for everybody.**
