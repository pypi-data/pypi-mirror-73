        =======
        
        1.8 (2020-07-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix re-rendering of widget if values required but empty dict passed.
          [rnix]
        
        - Remove ``dict_builder``. Entire widget is rendered now in ``dict_renderer``
          [rnix]
        
        - General code cleanup and modernization.

          [rnix]
        
        - Add ``key_label`` and ``value_label`` blueprint properties. They replace

          work when using dict blueprint in in yaml forms. ``head`` still works for
          B/C reasons.

          [rnix, 2016-06-28]
        
        - Use ``yafowil.utils.entry_point`` decorator.
          [rnix, 2016-06-27]
        
        - Minor bootstrap theme CSS changes.
