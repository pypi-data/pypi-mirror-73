This repository will be used to install the HA feature on AWS

It only consists of a setup.py file, which will generate a package called csr_aws_ha

Internally, the package will install csr_aws_utils and csr_ha packages

Customers can enable the HA functionality on AWS just by using this csr_aws_ha package
