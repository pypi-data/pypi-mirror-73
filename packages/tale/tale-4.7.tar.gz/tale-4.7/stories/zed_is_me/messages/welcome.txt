There's a small town somewhere in the countryside that almost nobody
reads or hears about. It's not really hidden but the road leading to
it is old and small, and used by very few.
The people in the town go about their
lives calmly and quietly, and honestly, it is a boring place.
It seems as if most of the outside world has forgotten about it.
The people in the town don't really care; they have little
business with the outside world.

The biggest employer in the town is a company called `ArtiGrow', making fertilizer.
Unfortunately, it has suffered financial problems for quite a while now
and had to lay off a lot of their staff. There aren't many vacancies
elsewhere, so a lot of these people sit at home pondering what to do...


Recently something very disturbing is happening in your village and you
have decided to leave it as soon as possible to try to search for help.
