You open the car's doors and Peter gets into the passenger seat.
Thankfully the convertible is in mint condition and after turning the
key in the ignition the engine roars to life.
Stepping on the gas, you steer the vehicle down the road and head
out of town. You should find the right people to tell about the
situation in your home town!

But that is part of the next chapter in this story.


Congratulations, you finished this little interactive fiction story!
