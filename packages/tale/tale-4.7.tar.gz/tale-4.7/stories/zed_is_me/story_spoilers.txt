Single-Player IF turn-based (command-driven).

***** WARNING: SPOILERS IN THIS TEXT ********


- GOAL: Escape village WITH friend WITH medicine.
- only a few wanderers left in some places that will (slowly) follow you and when they hit you -> GAME OVER
- 'flee' to get rid of them (they follow you when walking away normally)
- slowly spawn more wanderers to build up the pressure
- require keycard to free your friend Peter
- Peter will need a medicine before you can leave the village
- you'll have to 'haggle'/'bargain' that medicine from someone else
- haggling with less money (or simply give the full price $)
- find enough money first (haggle needs $10 at least, full price=$20)
