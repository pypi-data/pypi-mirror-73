<bright>CIRCLE ADMINS:</> A few custom commands have been provided for admins.
They are <monospaced>!cvnum</monospaced>, <monospaced>!cvgo</monospaced>
and <monospaced>!cvspawn</monospaced>.
They're similar to the built-in !vnum/!vgo/!vspawn commands but instead take
the circle-vnums instead as specified in the mud data files.
