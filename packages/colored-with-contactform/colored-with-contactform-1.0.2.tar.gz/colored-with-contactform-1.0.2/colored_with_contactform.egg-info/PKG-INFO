Description: # colored-with-contactform
        *Colored-with-contactform* is a theme for [pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) that I used for my personal blog, I make it public so everyone can benefit from it. I used css3 preprocessor `Sass` to make it easy to customized,  You can change the colors and font and sizes easy.
