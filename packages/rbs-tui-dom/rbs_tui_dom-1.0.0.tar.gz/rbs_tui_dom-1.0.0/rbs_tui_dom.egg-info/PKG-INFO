        # RBS TUI DOM
        The RBS Terminal User Interface (TUI) framework.
        
        ## Installation & Usage
        `pip install rbs-tui-dom`
        
        ## Examples
        Example code lives in the `example/` directory, and can be run directly after installation (`python examples/hello_world.py`) with the repository cloned.
        
        ## Overview
        rbs-tui-dom aims to mirror a DOM-like programming environment within the curses library.
        
        We provide several conveniences such as:
        * DOM elements with parent / child relationships
        * Styling
            * margin, padding, border, color, etc.
        * Events - both keyboard & mouse
            * Event propagation
            * Blur & focus
        * `get_element_by_id()`
        * Automatic re-rendering
        * Basic shell functionality
