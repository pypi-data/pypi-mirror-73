    # Run-time dependencies installed on `pip install`. To learn more
    # about "install_requires" vs pip's requirements files, see:
    #   https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html
    install_requires=requirements,

    # Specify which package(s) to install.
    # - Without any rules, find_packages returns, e.g.,
    #     ['dob_prompt', 'tests', 'tests.dob_prompt']
    # - With the 'exclude*' rule, this call is essentially:
    #     packages=['dob_prompt']
    packages=find_packages(exclude=['tests*']),

    # Tell setuptools to determine the version
    # from the latest SCM (git) version tag.
    #
    # Note that if the latest commit is not tagged with a version,
    # or if your working tree or index is dirty, then the version
    # from git will be appended with the commit hash that has the
    # version tag, as well as some sort of 'distance' identifier.
    # E.g., if a project has a '3.0.0a21' version tag but it's not
    # on HEAD, or if the tree or index is dirty, the version might
    # be:
    #   $ python setup.py --version
    #   3.0.0a22.dev3+g6f93d8c.d20190221
    # But if you clean up your working directory and move the tag
    # to the latest commit, you'll get the plain version, e.g.,
    #   $ python setup.py --version
    #   3.0.0a31
