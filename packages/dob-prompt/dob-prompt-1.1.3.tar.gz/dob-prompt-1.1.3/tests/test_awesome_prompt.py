# FIXME/2020-01-31: (lb): Change all the key_sequence lists below!
# - I copied this from dob-viewer/dob_viewer/tests/test_carousel.py
#   and only swapped out the Carousel for the Awesome Prompts; I did
#   not change the input! Still, dob-prompt went from 0% coverage all
#   the way to 73%, so, whatever, good ROI for a quick hack job!
