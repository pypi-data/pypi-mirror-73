"""Packaged conftest shim."""

# (lb): When I split dob into multiple projects, I moved the fixtures to
# the furthest class upstream (dob-bright) which we glob back in to
# conftest like they were originally. This is at the expense of violating
# best practices, and the linter's good graces. But then we also don't
# have to class out all the fixtures in the import statement, which for
# some reason seems like an anti-pattern in pytest (import? just put it
# all in conftest.py, we'll import that silently for you, why not).
