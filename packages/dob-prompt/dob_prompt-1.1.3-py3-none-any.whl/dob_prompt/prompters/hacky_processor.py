        # HISTORIC: (lb): The act@gory prompt used to be called twice
        # successively, once to get the Activity name, and once to get
        # the Category name. Before the second prompt session, the code
        # would ask that the completion dropdown be shown immediately:
        #     processor.start_completion = True
        # I've since made the act@gory Awesome Prompt gather both the
        # Activity and Category names in the same prompt session, so
        # this behavior is no longer exhibited, but the code remains
        # right here to start with the completions dropdown visible.

        # *** Optional: Hook completions drop down showing and hiding.

        # HACKTASTIC: (lb): Our prompter tracks the completions "signal edge".
        # Specifically, the prompter (more specifically, the validator) cares
        # when the completions dropdown is hidden, so that it can parse the
        # input text for the separator ('@') to fiddle with the input state
        # (which is either asking for the Activity name or asking for the
        # Category name).
        #
        # Within PPT itself, there's a callback, on_completions_changed, but
        # we cannot influence or access that feature via the PromptSession
        # interface that Awesome Prompt uses. So we report the state of the
        # completions dropdown to our prompter, and our prompter tracks the
        # signal edge (transitions from hiding to showing, and vice versa).
        # (Note that apply_transformation is called many times per input
        # character handled, so it's up to the prompter to only react when
        # the completions state changes, and not on every summoned() call.)

        # *** UX: Update Bottom Bar to accommodate completions drop down.

        # (lb): In addition to watching for completions dropdown state changes,
        # our prompter also rebuilds the PPT session's bottom_toolbar, whose
        # state also depends on whether completions are showing or not.
