Description: # probability_gaussian_binomial package
        
        This package adapts the object oriented style of programming to make a simple python based package for solving Gaussian and Binomial distributions.
        
        # Files
        
        1. Generaldistribution.py - This file contains the base class or general class for both the distributions and extending the features of this class using inheritance the other two files calculate their respective distributions.
        
        2. Gaussiandistribution.py - This file implements all the functions related to gaussian distribution including plotting the graphs.
        
        3. Binomialdistribution.py - This file implements all the functions related to binomial distribution including plotting the graphs.
