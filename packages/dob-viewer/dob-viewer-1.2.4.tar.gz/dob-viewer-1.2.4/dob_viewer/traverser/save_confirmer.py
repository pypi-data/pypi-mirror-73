    #   plumbed Carousel to have you *review* Facts being imported
    #   (and only those Facts; user did not see other Facts); but now
    #   user sees Carousel of all Facts, with imported Facts inserted,
    #   but not saved, and user saves through Carousel.
    #   - Which is fine, probably desirable. But because user might
    #     have insisted `not use_carousel`, this module still has
    #     code to save Facts independent of the Carousel.
    #     Nonetheless, the Carousel is still coded to return a Facts
    #     array...
    #     MAYBE/2020-01-28: Could probably remove gallop() return list,
    #                  I think nowadays it'll always be the empty list??

    # not necessarily guaranteed, so not a proper solution (and not even a
