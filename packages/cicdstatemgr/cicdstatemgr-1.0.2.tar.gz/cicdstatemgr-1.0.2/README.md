`cicdstatemgr` is a Python package who's intent is to make your life a bit easier when developing a CICD solution that needs to maintain state across multiple workflows and contexts of execution while providing a framework for enabling end-user interaction via tools like Slack.

This project was born out of needs that arised when building a custom CI/CD solution using the Kubernetes native [Tekton Pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) project.
