Google My Maps to MAPS.ME KML converter
=======================================

MAPS.ME just ignores colors and icon images on importing Google My Maps KML.
This simple tool tries to keep them.
MAPS.ME has much less available colors and icons.
So they are not the same as in the original KML from Google but they are as close as possible.
Feel free to suggest new icon mappings.

Usage
