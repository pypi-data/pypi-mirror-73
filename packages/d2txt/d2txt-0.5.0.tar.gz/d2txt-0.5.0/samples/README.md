The sample scripts in this directory are intended to be called from the command
line. Read each script's docstring and source code to see how `d2txt` can be
used.

Some scripts use [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) to color their
output. To install `colorama`, enter the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install colorama
```

Warning: **Some scripts will modify your files.** Back up your TXT files before
playing with the scripts. Use at your own risk.
