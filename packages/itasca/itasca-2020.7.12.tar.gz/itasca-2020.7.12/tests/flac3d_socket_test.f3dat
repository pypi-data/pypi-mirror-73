;; this is the FLAC3D side of the FLAC3D/Python coupling example.

;; FLAC3D is started by the Python program. When FLAC3D is started it
;; is given this input file as a command line argument. To start the
;; coupling example run this file by clicking the green button. The
;; open_socket FISH function opens a connection to the Python
;; program. FLAC3D then waits for the Python program to write a FISH
;; parameter. 1000.1 is added to the value and it is sent back to the
;; Python program. When FLAC3D receives a value of -1 from Python it
;; exits the read/write loop.
