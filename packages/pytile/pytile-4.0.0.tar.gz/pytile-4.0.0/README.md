`pytile` is a simple Python library for retrieving information on
[TileÂ® Bluetooth trackers](https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/) (including last
location and more).

This library is built on an unpublished, unofficial Tile API; it may alter or
cease operation at any point.

# Python Versions

`pytile` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8

# Installation

```python
pip install pytile
```

# Usage

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import async_login


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    client = await async_login("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>")

    # Get all Tiles associated with an account:
    await client.tiles.all()


asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, the library creates a new connection to Tile with each coroutine. If you are
calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second of
runtime savings possible), an
[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection
pooling:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import async_login


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        client = await async_login("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session)

        # Get all Tiles associated with an account:
        await client.tiles.all()


asyncio.run(main())
```

If for some reason you need to use a specific client UUID (to, say, ensure that the
Tile API sees you as a client it's seen before) or a specific locale, you can do
so easily:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from pytile import async_login


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    client = await async_login(
        "<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", client_uuid="MY_UUID", locale="en-GB"
    )

    # Get all Tiles associated with an account:
    await client.tiles.all()


asyncio.run(main())
```
