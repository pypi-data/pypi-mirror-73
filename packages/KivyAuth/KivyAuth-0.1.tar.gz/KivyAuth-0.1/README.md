###
#### Google and Facebook logins have been implemented natively. See [here](docs/integrate-google-facebook-login.md) to implement it yourself.
#### Firebase has been used for integrating Github and Twitter logins. See [here](docs/integrate-firebase-auth.md) to implement it yourself.

##
### Releases:
* Contains a debug apk in [bin](https://github.com/shashi278/social-auth-kivy/tree/master/bin) directory.

### TODO:
* Make it a sole package so that everyone don't need to write all those codes everytime. 
* I'm not sure why `AsyncImage` is not working for me and not showing any profile picture.
