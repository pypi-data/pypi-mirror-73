        prop is a library of Reinforcment Learning agents implemented in pytorch.
        
        ## Algorithms
        
        |         | Model      | Policy     |
        |---------|------------|------------|
        | **DQN** | Model-Free | Off-Policy |
        | **A2C** | Model-Free | On-Policy  |
        
        ## DQN
        
        [Deep Q-Learning][1] is a variant of Q-learning with a deep neural network used for estimating Q-values (hence DQN; Deep Q-Network).
        
        Both DQN and DDQN (Double DQN) are implemented.
        
        ## A2C
        
        [Advantage Actor Critic][2] is a variant of Actor-Critic that:
        - Uses a neural network to approximate a policy and a value function.
        - Computes the advantage of an action to scale the computed gradients. This acts as a vote of confidence (or skepticism) on actions produced by the actor.
