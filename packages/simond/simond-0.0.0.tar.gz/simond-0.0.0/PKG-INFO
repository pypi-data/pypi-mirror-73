Description: # simond - **Si**mple **Mon**itor _Daemon_
        
        The daemon for **simon**, collects system information every second and logs them
        to STDOUT (redirect or pipe it to your liking) at a certain interval.
        If the interval is not 1 sec, the sample mean will be calculated and logged.
        
        ## Installation
        
        simond requires Python 3.6+, the easiest way to install it is with `pip` or any other package manager supporting PyPI:
        
        ```sh
        pip install simond
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        usage: simond [-h] [-V] [-i LOGINTERVAL]

        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -V, --version         Print simond version number
          -i LOGINTERVAL, --loginterval LOGINTERVAL
                                The log interval in seconds, if it's anything but 1,
                                averages (sample mean) will be logged
        ```
        
        ## Log structure
        
        - `host`: The system's hostname
        - `ts`: Timestamp of when the data were gathered as UTC Unix time
        - `loadavg_1min`: 1min [Load average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_%28computing%29)
        - `loadavg_5min`: 5min Load average
        - `loadavg_15min`: 15min Load average
        - `mem`: Total memory usage in percent as number (0.01 = 1%)
        - `cpu`: Total CPU usage in percent as number
        - `disk`: Total disk usage in percent as number
        - `diskio_rps`: Disk reads in bytes per second
        - `diskio_wps`: Disk writes in bytes per second
        - `netio_rps`: Network traffic received in bytes per second
        - `netio_sps`: Network traffic sent in bytes per second
        
        Currently **simon** logs each measure as a JSON object separated by newline, the
        file will therefor not be valid JSON, with the benefit that each line is valid JSON and can be read per line (streaming FTW!):
        
        ```json
        {"host": "simon", "ts": 1592943008, "loadavg_1min": 1.598, "loadavg_5min": 2.104, "loadavg_15min": 2.504, "mem": 0.03, "cpu": 0.014, "disk": 0.545, "diskio_rps": 0, "diskio_wps": 0, "netio_rps": 0, "netio_sps": 0}
        {"host": "simon", "ts": 1592943009, "loadavg_1min": 1.598, "loadavg_5min": 2.104, "loadavg_15min": 2.504, "mem": 0.03, "cpu": 0.036, "disk": 0.545, "diskio_rps": 0, "diskio_wps": 0, "netio_rps": 1024, "netio_sps": 0}
        ```
