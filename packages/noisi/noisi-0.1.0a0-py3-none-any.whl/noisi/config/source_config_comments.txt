# get_auto_corr: compute autocorrelations (true / false)
# rotate_horizontal_components: During modeling, should ENZ
# be rotated to RTZ with respect to the interstation azimuth (true / false)
# diagonals: (true / false): If wavefield channel is set to "all" in
# config.json, this setting will determine if only diagonals or all 
# components of the cross-correlation tensor are modelled.
# model_observed_only: if true, only station pairs for which observations
#     are found in the observed_correlations folder will be modelled
# max_lag: Maximum lag for cross-correlation in seconds
# source setup file: File containing parameters that describe the 
#     starting model for the source: Find an example
#     under examples/source_setup_parameters.yaml
