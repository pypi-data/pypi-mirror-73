What's new in v1.0:

1. BUILT IN TWILIO!!!!

2. Runs HYPERfast!!!!

What's new in v1.1:

1. Added repl functionality (https://twilioSMS--johndo3.repl.co)

Instructions:

go to https://www.twilio.com and sign up, follow instructions, then get account sid, auth token, and twilio number and import them into run.py (the file where the code runs)

credit goes to CleverProgrammer for creating the base code for this program, and to twilio Inc for providing me with the database

code (file MUST be called run.py, you can use main.py on repl.it)

    import twilioSMS


    # get these credentials by signing up for a twilio account at https://www.twilio.com
    account_sid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"  # insert your account SID here
    auth_token = "your_auth_token"  # insert your authenication token here
    my_cell = "cell number here"  # insert your phone number starting with +1
    my_twilio = "twilio number here"  # insert your twilio number starting with +1


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        twilioSMS

or, in the terminal(BETA TESTING), type:

    python sms.py

you whil have to type in everything in manually, though.
