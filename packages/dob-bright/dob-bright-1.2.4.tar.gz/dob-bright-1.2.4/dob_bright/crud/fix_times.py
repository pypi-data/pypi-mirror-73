# (lb): This is one of the more complicated modules in dob.
# - It almost feels like it belongs in nark, but nark does not do any
#   conflict detection nor resolution, which is what this module is all
#   about.
# - I'm also aware there might be some duplicate code between the import
#   and add facts commands, but conflict resolution, and squashing and
#   extending facts, is tricky business. Especially when the API is not
#   documented nor designed extremely robustly but grew more organically.
#   - One goal when adding tests is to document -- via tests -- all the
#     add and import use cases. Run coverage on specific use cases could
#     help a developer better understand this code.

# FIXME/TESTING/2019-01-22: Test adding fact when there's an ongoing Fact.
#   - Test new Fact with and without start.
#     - A new Fact without start gets squashed into current ongoing Fact?
#     - A new Fact with a start ends the current ongoing.
#   - Three ways to add new Fact: 1.) single CLI command; 2.) Carousel; 3.) import.
#   - Or does other code handle ongoing Fact, I don't remember...

# NOTE/2019-01-22: insert_forcefully checks one Fact being edited against
# the store only, and it ignores any other edited Facts you might have.
# The current use cases define this restriction:
# - The command line only lets the user edit one Fact at a time;
# - The Carousel manages it own set of edited Facts and does not
#   need (call) this function (and it will not let user change a
#   Fact's start or end time if the new Fact's times would fully
#   shadow another Fact's times);
# - The import function will let a user edit multiple Facts, but
#   it die-complains if *any* Fact conflicts, so its use of this
#   function is only in the context of a single Fact vs. the db.
