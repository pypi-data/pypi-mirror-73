# Note: Cannot use pytest_plugins here, e.g.,:
#   pytest_plugins = (
#       "nark.tests.backends.sqlalchemy.conftest",
#       # Make sure fixtures required by fixtures available, e.g., 'base_config'.
#       "nark.tests.conftest",
#   )
# because:
#   Defining 'pytest_plugins' in a non-top-level conftest is no longer supported.
