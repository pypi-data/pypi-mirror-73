    >>> # "sent". 
    >>> data = emailpy.readmail("toemail1@gmail.com", "toemail1_password") # read
    >>> # email "toemail1@gmail.com" with password "toemail1_password"
    >>> data = data[0] # get first email from EmailMessageList object
    >>> data.body # "Body"
    >>> data.subject # "Subject"
    >>> data.html # "Body"
    >>> data.sender # "fromemail@gmail.com"
    >>> data.recvers # ["toemail1@gmail.com", "toemail2@gmail.com"]
    >>> data.show() # <showing in selenium chrome>
    >>> data.attachments # <EmailAttachment Object filenames=["file.txt",
    >>> # "picture.png"]>
    >>> data.attachments.download() # save attached files to computer
    >>> data.attachments.show() # show attached files
    >>> # WARNING: when using data.attachments.show(), you must first call
    >>> # data.attachments.download()
    >>> data.is_attachment # True
    >>> data.delete() # delete email
    >>> emailpy.sendmailobj(sent, attachments = ['file2.txt']) # send the sent
    >>> # variable as an email, but replacing the attachments list with
    >>> # ['file2.txt'].
    >>> emailpy.forward(data, 'forwardtome@yahoo.com', body = 'hi') # forward
    >>> # the read email to "forwardtome@yahoo.com", but replacing the body
    >>> # with "hi". NOTE that this only works on read emails. So, you cannot
    >>> # use the emailpy.forward() method on sent or forwarded emails.
