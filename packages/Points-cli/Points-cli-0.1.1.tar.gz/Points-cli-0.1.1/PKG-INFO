Description: 
        POINTS-CLI
        ----------
        Use this program to display random points and measure angles and distances
        between them.
        
        Description:
        -----------
        
        Points-cli is a small program that takes a given number of randomly generated 
        points in 3-Dimensions and plots them in multiple colors using matplotlib. It
        then allows for the measurement of angles and distances between the points. 
        The points are restricted within boundaries of a box. The user interacts with
        the program through both the command line interface and the matplotlib plot.
        From the command line interface the user is taken through elaborative steps
        that describe the proper arguments and options. The plot is a 3D scatter plot
        with an extra feature that enables the user to hover the mouse over any point
        to display the number assigned to that point.
        
        After the plot has been displayed an access to a menu appears on the command
        line with three options: Measure distance, Measure angle and Exit.

        Help:
        ----
        To make the program run faster opt for a smaller number of points depending 
        on the processing power and memory available at your disposal.
        
        You can always use Ctrl+C to prematurely exit the program.
