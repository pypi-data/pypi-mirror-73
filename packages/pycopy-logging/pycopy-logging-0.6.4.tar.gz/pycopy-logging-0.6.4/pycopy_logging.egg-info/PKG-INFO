Description: logging
        =======
        
        logging is Pycopy's implementation of a subset of CPythons logging module. This
        module defines functions and classes which implement a flexible event logging system for
        applications and libraries.
        
        Major differences to CPython logging:
        
        * No event propagation: events logged to a logger will not be passed to the handlers of
          higher level (ancestor) logger. In CPython this matches the behaviour achieved by
          setting ``Logger.propagate = False``.
        * Filters are not supported
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        At the time of writing, logging requires the `os <https://pypi.org/project/pycopy-os/>`_
        package (installed automatically by the ``upip`` tool).
