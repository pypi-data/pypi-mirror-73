        A hack to run custom steps when building documentation on Read the Docs. 
        
        __Configuration__
        
        ```yml
        # .readthedocs.yml
        version: 2
        mkdocs: {}  # tell readthedocs to use mkdocs
        python:
          version: 3.7
          install:
            - requirements: requirements.txt  # must contain "readthedocs-custom-steps"
        ```
        
        ```yml
        # .readthedocs-custom-steps.yml
        steps:
        - echo "Custom steps to produce HTML in $SITE_DIR here ..."
        ```
        
        > __Important__: This module should not be installed outside of a Read the Docs build environment.
        > It will rename your Python executable and install a substitute. It does not currently provide an
        > automated way to revert this change.
        
        __Testing this package__
        
        To test this package in a similar environment as Read the Docs itself, you can run `make test`.
        Note that this requires Docker and a Docker volume called `pip-caches`. Note that the Make command
        is expected to return status code `27` as defined in the `test/.readthedocs-custom-steps.yml` file.
        
        __Release process__
        
        Requires [Shore](https://pypi.org/project/nr.shore).
        
            $ make bump TYPE=--minor
            $ make publish
