        ticketutil is a Python module that allows you to easily interact with
        various ticketing tools using their REST APIs. Currently, the supported
        tools are JIRA, RT, Redmine, Bugzilla, and ServiceNow. All tools support
        HTTP Basic authentication, while JIRA and RT also support Kerberos
        authentication.
        
        This module allows you to create tickets, add comments, edit ticket
        fields, and change the status of tickets in each tool. Additional
        lower-level tool-specific functions are supported - adding and removing
        watchers in JIRA, adding attachments in JIRA, etc.
        
        Simplify all of your ticketing operations with ticketutil:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from ticketutil.jira import JiraTicket
            ticket = JiraTicket(<jira_url>, <project_key>, auth='kerberos')
        
            # Create a ticket and perform some common ticketing operations.
            t = ticket.create(summary='Ticket summary',
                              description='Ticket description',
                              type='Task')
            t = ticket.add_comment('Test Comment')
            t = ticket.change_status('Done')
        
            # Check status of previous ticketing operation and print URL of ticket.
            print(t.status)
            print(t.url)
        
            # Close Requests session.
            ticket.close_requests_session()
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install ticketutil with ``pip install ticketutil``.
        
        ticketutil is compatible with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
        Note: For Python 2.6 and lower, an additional package, importlib, may
        need to be installed.
        
        If not installing with pip, a short list of packages defined in the
        requirements.txt file need to be installed. To install the required
        packages, type ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
        
        Documentation
        -------------

        For ServiceNow related questions, email pzubaty@redhat.com.
        
        The plan for ticketutil is to support more ticketing tools in the near
        future and to support more ticketing operations for the currently
        supported tools. Please let us know if there are any suggestions /
        requests.

          for more details.
        * HTTP Basic Auth support has been added to JIRA.
        
        1.2.0 (04-28-2017)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * ServiceNow support has been added to ticketutil!
        
          - ticketutil/servicenow.py has been created, supporting main ticketing
            functions found in other tools.
          - tests/test_servicenow.py has been created, containing unit tests for
            servicenow.py.
          - Two new documentation files have been created: docs/servicenow.md and
            examples/servicenow_examples.md.
        
        1.1.0 (04-18-2017)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * JIRA, Bugzilla, RT, Redmine
        
          - Added get_ticket_url() method to return ticket url for Ticket object.
          - Added get_ticket_id() method to return ticket id for Ticket object.
          - Added _verify_project() and _verify_ticket_id() methods to all tools.
            These methods are called when a new Ticket object is created to verify
            that the project and optional ticket_id parameters are valid.
          - Created TicketException class, which is raised if the url passed in
            during creation of a Ticket object can not be accessed. This exception
            is also raised if project or ticket_id can not be verified.
          - The environment variable TICKETUTIL_DEBUG has been replaced with
            TICKETUTIL_LOG_LEVEL, with a default value of 'INFO'. This allows you to
            turn on debug logging by setting this variable to 'DEBUG' and effectively
            turn off logging by setting it to 'CRITICAL'.
        
        * JIRA
        
          - Modified _get_status_id() in jira.py to return the status_id
            corresponding to the state you are transitioning to, instead of the
            status_id corresponding to the transition itself.
        
        * Bugzilla
        
          - Added add_attachment() method.
          - Added support for api_key authentication.
          - Added support for adding groups to ticket in create() and edit().
        
        * RT
        
          - Added add_attachment() method.
        
        * Redmine
        
          - Added add_attachment() method.
