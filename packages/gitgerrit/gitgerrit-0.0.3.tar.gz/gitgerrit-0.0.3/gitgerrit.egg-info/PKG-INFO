        ==========
        
        Command line to to interact with gerrit and its ci integrations.. Made for internal use but
        could be useful for others too.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install gitgerrit`
        
        After the package has been installed, its available via `git gerrit`.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        At this time, git gerrit has 3 sub commands. `runverify` `topic` & `abandon`
        
        Each of these subcommands operate at the current git branch's head commit unless you pass  `--commit N` or `--changeid N` flags.
        
        If also pass `--support-chain` flag, all operations are targetting whole commit chains that.
        
        you can also specify logging level via --loglevel=$level flag.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        You must provide following settings in your local or global git configuration:
        ```
        [gerrit]
          token = $gerrit_restapi_token
          user = $gerrit_username
          host = $gerrit_hostname
        ```
        
        Or, you can set corresponding environment variables: GERRIT_TOKEN, GERRIT_USER, GERRIT_HOST
        
        ### runverify
        
        `git gerrit runverify` will add a comment to latest revision of current comment if it ha been published into gerrit.
        If you want to add the commit to some other change, you can use `--changeid` or `--commit`
        
        If you want to to check the state votes of the change request, append `--check` flag to `runverify`
        
        ### abandon
        
        `git gerrit abandon` will abandon current change request if its already in gerrit. If you have been working on a commit chain and
        you would like to abandon it as  whole:  `git gerrit --support-chain abandon`
        
        ### topic
        
        `git gerrit topic --check` will show all the commits/changes in gerrit in your current commit chain.
        
        If you wish to set a topic to a single commit:
        
        `git gerrit topic --set newtopic`
        
        Default value for topic is always "noci".
        
        `git gerrit --support-chain topic` will set topic of all changes in your commit chain except the HEAD into "noci". Same command
        could be also written as `git gerrit --support-chain topic --set noci`
