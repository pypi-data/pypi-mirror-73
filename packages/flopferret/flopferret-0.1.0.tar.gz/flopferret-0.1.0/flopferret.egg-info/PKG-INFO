        Installation
        ------------
        
        ### Windows
        Download the release [here](https://github.com/JulianAndrews/flopferret/releases).
        
        ### Debian/Ubuntu with Python 3.7
        
            sudo apt-get install python3-pip
            python3 -m pip install --user flopferret
        
        Assuming normal defaults, the executable should be at `~/.local/bin/flopferret`
        
        ### Other versions of Linux
        
        Installation is currently largely manual. First install
        [pyEval7](https://github.com/JulianAndrews/pyeval7), and
        [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/). Once you have those installed,
        the instructions for Debian/Ubuntu should work.
        
        ### MacOS
        
        Currently MacOS is unsupported. There's a chance it could be made to work
        without too much effort though, so if you'd like to see flopferret working on
        MacOS show your interest
