==========
Texas Hold'em board texture analyzer.

Installation
------------

### Debian with Python 3.7, Ubuntu with Python 3.6, MacoOS

Download the the latest release [here](https://github.com/JulianAndrews/flopferret/releases).

For Ubuntu you'll need a version with a Python 3.6 package, and for Debian
Python 3.7. The MacOS install includes a bundled python interpreter.

### Windows

Download the Alpha release
[here](https://github.com/julianandrews/flopferret/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha).

### Other versions of Linux

Make sure you have pip installed for Python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 `pip --version`
should let you know). Then:

    pip install flopferret

should be all you need. On Linux systems I recommend

    pip install --user flopferret

Better yet, install it in a virtualenv, and link the `flopferret` binary to
somewhere on your path.
