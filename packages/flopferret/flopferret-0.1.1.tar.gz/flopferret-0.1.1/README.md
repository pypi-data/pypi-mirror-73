FlopFerret
==========
Texas Hold'em board texture analyzer.

Installation
------------

### Windows
Download the release [here](https://github.com/JulianAndrews/flopferret/releases).

### Debian/Ubuntu with Python 3.7

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    python3 -m pip install --user flopferret

Assuming normal defaults, the executable should be at `~/.local/bin/flopferret`

### Other versions of Linux

Installation is currently largely manual. First install
[pyEval7](https://github.com/JulianAndrews/pyeval7), and
[PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/). Once you have those installed,
the instructions for Debian/Ubuntu should work.

### MacOS

Currently MacOS is unsupported. There's a chance it could be made to work
without too much effort though, so if you'd like to see flopferret working on
MacOS show your interest
