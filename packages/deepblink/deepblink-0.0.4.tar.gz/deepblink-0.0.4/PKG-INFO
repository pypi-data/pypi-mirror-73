        deepBlink
        ============
        
        Threshold independent detection and localization of diffraction-limited spots.
        
        
        Overview
        ============
        In biomedical microscopy data, a common task involves the detection of
        diffraction-limited spots that visualize single proteins, domains, mRNAs,
        and many more. These spots were traditionally detected with mathematical
        operators such as Laplacian of Gaussian. These operators, however, rely
        on human input ranging from image-intensity thresholds, approximative
        spot sizes, etc. This process is tedious and not always reliable. DeepBlink
        relies on neural networks to automatically find spots without the need for
        human intervention. DeepBlink is available as a ready-to-use command-line
        interface.

        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install deepblink
        
        You can also install the in-development version with::

        Development
        ===========
        
        To run the all tests run::
        
            tox
        
        Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:
        
        .. list-table::
            :widths: 10 90
            :stub-columns: 1

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.0.4 (2020-07-10)
        ------------------
        
        * Addition of command line interface (currently without verbosity capabilities).
        * Bin/ folder with ready to use training script.
        * Removal of src/ directory. Deepblink is now sailing GitHub on its own.
        * Major docs overhaul with the addition of more detailed input / functionality descriptions and the addition of a usage overview and example in README.
        * @zhanyinx is now listed as co-author.
        
        
        0.0.3 (2020-07-02)
        ------------------
        
        * First custom code release.
        * All utility functions and training loop included.
        * CLI still cookiecutter and not functional.
        * First of five patches leading up to the first minor version:
        
            * v0.0.3 Utility functions.
            * v0.0.4 Command line interface for inference and script folder for training.
            * v0.0.5 Evaluation added to measure performance on test dataset.
            * v0.0.6 Addition of tests and completion of current TODO's.
            * V0.0.7 Benchmarks/functions added to compare deepblink to other methods.
        
        0.0.2 (2020-06-29)
        ------------------
        
        * Still cookiecutter code but addition of docstrings to test sphinx apidoc capabilities.
        
        0.0.1 (2020-06-24)
        ------------------
