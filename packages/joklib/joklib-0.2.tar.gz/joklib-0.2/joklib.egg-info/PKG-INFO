Description: This Library allows you with only a few lines of code to read out the klima data from J-O. Techniks Klimaboxen.
        If you don`t have one of these or a simmillar system you wouldn`t probably use this library, because its main
        function is to provide a simple accsess to them and also a few other things that good python programmers doesn`t
        need, cause of their experience.
