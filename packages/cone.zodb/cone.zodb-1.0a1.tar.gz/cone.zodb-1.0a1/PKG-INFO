        This package provides ZODB integration in ``cone.app`` and basic
        application nodes for publishing ZODB models.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        1.0a1 (2020-07-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix case where ``_v_parent`` is not set if ``ZODBEntryNode`` is not read via
          ``ZODBEntryStorage`` but from ZODB root directly.
          [rnix]
        
        - Remove ``AsAttrAccess``, ``Nodespaces``, and ``Attributes`` behaviors from
          ``ZODBEntry``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Add ``ZODBEntryStorage.attrs``. Returns attributes of related
          ``ZODBEntryNode``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Add ``ZODBEntryNode.__getitem__``. Sets ``ZODBEntryNode.entry`` as parent
          on children to keep traversal and acquisition paths sane.
          [rnix]
        
        - Access ``principal_roles`` when initializing nodes with ``ZODBPrincipalACL``
          behavior applied to avoid lazy creation. Needed to prevent ``_p_changed``
          being set on first access.
          [rnix]
        
        - Do not remember ``principal_roles`` via ``instance_property`` decorator
          on ``ZODBEntryPrincipalACL`` to avoid ``ZODB.POSException.ConnectionStateError``
          errors.
          [rnix]
        
        - Proper handling of ``ZODBEntry`` and ``ZODBEntryNode`` in ``zodb_path``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Add ``include_entry`` attribute to ``CatalogAware`` behavior. Flag controls
          whether to index entry node in calatog.
          [rnix]
        
        - Add ``entry`` property to ``ZODBEntryNode``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Use ``pyramid_zodbconn`` instead of ``repoze.zodbconn``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Set ``node.interfaces.IOrdered`` on ``cone.zodb.entry.ZODBEntry`` to fix
          ``treerepr``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Python 3 compatibility.
          [rnix]
        
        - Upgrade to ``cone.app`` 1.0b1.
          [rnix]
        
        
        < 1.0
        -----
        
        - Initial work.
