    MaxRects tracks all available space in a texture, potentially in very long
    list of overlapping free regions. Adding a rect partitions any intersecting
    free regions so that they do not intersect - potentially creating up to
    4 new free regions for each intersecting free region.

    Packing is very good but can be very slow, particularly when the size of
    rects requested is a small fraction of the available space; this tends to
    create very large numbers of free regions.

    This implementation takes around 40ms to pack 500 randomly sized sprites,
    but as much as 4100ms to pack 500 font glyphs with a low size distribution.

    To control this growth a parameter threshold limits the size of areas we
    keep track of. An area whose smallest dimension is less than threshold is
    not tracked - possibly other larger overlapping regions contain some of the
    space. Threshold values between 16 and 32 give significant speedups without
    badly affecting packing efficiency.

    A reasonable description of MaxRects is here:
