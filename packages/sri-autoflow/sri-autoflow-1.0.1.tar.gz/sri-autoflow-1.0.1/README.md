## 1. What is in this repository
This repository is for the Autoflow Pipeline optimization tool. Autoflow explores available primitives and 
constructs pipelines to address various types of problems. The back end that performs the pipeline search
is the Genetic Algorithm called [GAMA](https://github.com/PGijsbers/gama.git). This application was developed during the
DARPA sponsored D3M project.

## 3. Installation
There are various ways of using the Autoflow tool. Each is explained below.


### 3.1 Pip
1. Before starting, it is recommended that you create a conda environment using the following commands. This will allow
you to keep the environment used to support Autoflow separate from your other work:

    ```conda create -n <environment name> python=3.6.9```<br>
    ```conda activate <environment name>```


2. Due to current project state there are some extra, temporary steps that are required to install Autoflow. It is 
expected that each of these will be addressed by projects end which will allow a simple pip install. The first of these 
extra steps is to install dependencies that cannot be captured by the python setup tools. Download the requirements.txt
file located [here](https://gitlab.com/daraghhartnett/tpot-ta2/-/blob/master/requirements.txt) and run the following 
in the conda environment you created in the previous step:

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    
3. Run pip install to get the released version of the sri-autoflow library. Other versions of Autoflow are available on 
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sri-autoflow/):

    ```pip install sri-autoflow==1.0.0```
    
4. Edit the conda installed lib/python3.6/site-packages/d3m/index.py file to remove the reference to pycurl. This has 
been fixed in a later version of d3m core so this step should not be necessary for long. If you are unable to find the 
location of this file, simply run autoflow in the next step and it will print an exception showing the full path to the 
file. The line that needs to be commented out is line number 21:

    ```import pycurl  # type: ignore```
    
5. Depending on your version of python and your platform it is possilkle you will see errors related to xgboost which is
required for some of the common primitives. If that occurs, run the following commands to build the binaries manually:
    
    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost
    cd xgboost; cp make/minimum.mk ./config.mk; make -j4
    cd python-package; python setup.py develop --user
    ```

6. Autoflow is now ready to use! In order to search for solutions to a problem you will need the following:

    - Single table csv file with column names. An example of this for the baseball dataset can be viewed 
    [here](https://gitlab.datadrivendiscovery.org/d3m/datasets/blob/master/seed_datasets_current/185_baseball_MIN_METADATA/TRAIN/dataset_TRAIN/tables/learningData.csv)
    - Target column name that should be used to train the model. Following the example of the baseball dataset, the 
    'Hall_of_Fame' column is generally used.
    - Configuration file. A sample configuration file can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/daraghhartnett/tpot-ta2/-/blob/master/config/search_config_pip_installed.json)
     This contains parameters to guide Autoflow in its search:
        - Where to write the output of the search
        - Time limit to search for pipelines in minutes 
        - Maximum number of CPU's
        - Maximum RAM allocation 
        - Some other internal parameters dealing with the backend
    
7. Using the example inputs described in the previous step, here is a sample call to autoflow:

    ```autoflow /datasets/seed_datasets_current/185_baseball_MIN_METADATA/TRAIN/dataset_TRAIN/tables/learningData.csv search_config_pip_installed.json Hall_of_Fame```
    
    This will produce output like the following (summarized for clarity):
    
    ```

8. Once the search is complete (see final log message in the previous step), look in the folder specified as the output directory
 in the config file. The following file structure should be visible:
 
    ```angular2
    drwxr-xr-x   2 user  staff    64 Jul  7 17:00 additional_inputs
    drwxr-xr-x   2 user  staff    64 Jul  7 17:00 pipeline_runs
    drwxr-xr-x  42 user  staff  1344 Jul  7 17:11 pipelines_ranked
    drwxr-xr-x  74 user  staff  2368 Jul  7 17:11 pipelines_scored
    drwxr-xr-x   2 user  staff    64 Jul  7 17:00 pipelines_searched
    drwxr-xr-x   2 user  staff    64 Jul  7 17:00 subpipelines
    drwxr-xr-x   2 user  staff    64 Jul  7 17:11 temp
    ```
       
    Inside the `pipelines_ranked` directory there will be two files for each of the 20 best pipelines. The files are 
    grouped by the pipline UID which has the following form: `0eaa146d-d569-4ec7-9780-5d7a770b1c62`. The first file is a 
    `.rank` file which as the rank of that pipeline. A rank of `1` is considered the best, a rank of `20` is considered
    the poorest. The `.json` file describes the pipeline in detail. For information on how to interpret this file 
    structure see the [D3M Pipeline documentation](https://docs.datadrivendiscovery.org/v2020.5.18/pipeline.html#pipeline)
    
    The `pipelines_scored` directory contains all the other pipelines that were found during search but were deemed to 
    not be as good as the 20 ranked pipelines.
    
9. Now that pipelines have been discovered, they can be run on hold out data to see how they perform at predicting the 
values in the target column. An example of this data for the baseball dataset can be found 
[here](https://gitlab.datadrivendiscovery.org/d3m/datasets/blob/master/seed_datasets_current/185_baseball_MIN_METADATA/TEST/dataset_TEST/tables/learningData.csv)    

    To run that pipelines on the test data the D3M library has a reference runtime. This can be invoked as follows:
    
    ```python3 -m d3m runtime fit-produce -p pipeline.json -r problem/problemDoc.json -i dataset_TRAIN/datasetDoc.json -t dataset_TEST/datasetDoc.json -o results.csv -O pipeline_run.yml```
    
    For further information on running pipelines see the 
    [D3M Reference Runtime documentation](https://docs.datadrivendiscovery.org/v2020.5.18/pipeline.html#reference-runtime)
     
10. If you ever need to remove your conda environment to start over use the following commands:

    ```conda deactivate```<br>
    ```conda remove -n <environment name> --all```
