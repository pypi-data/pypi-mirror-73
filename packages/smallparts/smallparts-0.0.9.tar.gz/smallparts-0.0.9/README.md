# Smallparts

A humble collection of convenience modules for use with Python 3

This project mainly focuses on text conversion.
The Python package documentation can be found
[here](https://github.com/blackstream-x/smallparts/tree/master/docs "docs/ subdirectory of the GitHub project").

Note: this project is forked off a sample project that exists for
PyPUG's "Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Projects"
(<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject>).
Apart from the basic structure of the package,
this project shares nothing in commmon with its parent.
