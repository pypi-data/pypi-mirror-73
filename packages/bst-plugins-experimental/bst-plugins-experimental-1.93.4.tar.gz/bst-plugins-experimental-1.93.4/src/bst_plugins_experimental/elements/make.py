make - Make build element
=========================
This is a `BuildElement
<https://docs.buildstream.build/master/buildstream.scriptelement.html#module-buildstream.scriptelement>`_
implementation for using GNU make based build.

.. note::

   The ``make`` element is available since `format version 9
   <https://docs.buildstream.build/master/format_project.html#project-format-version>`_

Here is the default configuration for the ``make`` element in full:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../src/bst_plugins_experimental/elements/make.yaml
     :language: yaml

See `built-in functionality documentation
<https://docs.buildstream.build/master/buildstream.buildelement.html#core-buildelement-builtins>`_ for
details on common configuration options for build elements.
