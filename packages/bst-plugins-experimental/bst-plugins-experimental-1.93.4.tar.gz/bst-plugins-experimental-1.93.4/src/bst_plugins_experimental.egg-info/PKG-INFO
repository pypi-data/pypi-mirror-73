Description: BuildStream Plugins
        *******************
        
        A collection of plugins for the BuildStream project.
        
        How to use this repo
        ====================
        
        At the moment, this repo is a sort of incubation repo; it contains things
        which explicitly don't yet have strong API guarantees.
        
        Therefore, for the time being we recommend use bst-plugins-experimental as a submodule
        for your buildstream projects.
        
        Using the plugins locally within a project
        ------------------------------------------
        To use the bst-plugins-experimental plugins locally within a
        `BuildStream <https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream>`_
        project, you will first need to clone the repo to a location **within your
        project**::
        
            git clone https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/bst-plugins-experimental.git
        
        The plugins must be declared in *project.conf*. To do this, please refer
        to BuildStream's
        `Local plugins documentation <https://buildstream.gitlab.io/buildstream/format_project.html#local-plugins>`_.
        
        Using the plugins as a Python package
        -------------------------------------
        To use the bst-plugins-experimental plugins as a Python package within a
        `BuildStream <https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream>`_
        project, you will first need to install bst-plugins-experimental via pip::
        
            git clone https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/bst-plugins-experimental.git
            cd bst-plugins-experimental
            pip install --user -e .
        
        To ensure it's installed, try: ``pip show bst-plugins-experimental``, this should
        show information about the package.
        
        .. note::
           The -e option ensures that changes made to the git repository are reflected
           in the Python package's behaviour.
        
        Then, the plugins must be declared in the *project.conf*. The implementation of
        this is explained in BuildStream's
        `Pip plugins documentation <https://buildstream.gitlab.io/buildstream/format_project.html#pip-plugins>`_
