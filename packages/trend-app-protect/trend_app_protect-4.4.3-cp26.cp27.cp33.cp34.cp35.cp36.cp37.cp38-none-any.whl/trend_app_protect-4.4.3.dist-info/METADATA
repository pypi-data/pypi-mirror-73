# Trend Micro Cloud One Application Security for Python

## What is it?
Trend Micro Cloud One - Application Security provides real-time application security as a service for modern applications, APIs, serverless and other computing platforms. When Application Security is deployed, threats to your web applications will be detected and protected against, minimizing your risk.

## Features
Application Security detects and protects against a wide range of attacks at runtime within your entire application, including:
SQL injections
Remote command execution 
Illegal file access 
Malicious file uploads
Malicious payloads
URL redirects
And more


## Installation

Add the Trend Micro Application Security package to *requirements.txt*:

```
trend_app_protect
```

Run pip to install the package:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Import the `trend_app_protect.start` module at the top of your WSGI script:

```python
import trend_app_protect.start
```

## Configuration

The agent key and secret can be configured via the `TREND_AP_KEY` and `TREND_AP_SECRET` environment variables.

Optionally, you can provide a configuration in the file *trend_app_protect.ini* under the root of the project or under */etc* but the environment variables will still take precedence:

```ini
[trend_app_protect]
key = my-key
secret = my-secret
```
