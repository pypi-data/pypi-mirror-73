        ft-Explore was implemented to interface with hardware of technical models for educational purposes. It is open-source and contains interface modules for widely available hardware (RaspberryPi with Adafruit Motor HAT).

        ## Installation
        
        ft-Explore can be installed easily. See the sections below depending on your platform.
        
        ### Windows
        
        - Download msi installer file (can be found "dist" folder)
        - Install using the msi installer
        - Afterwards the application can be started via shortcut "ft-Explore" in start menu
        
        Alternatively, you can download the source code and run it after installing Python (e.g. via https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). See the Linux section below for required Python packages.
        
        ### Linux
        
        - Make sure that you use Python version 3.5 or newer
        - Install Python libraries as needed:
        
        > in case the application shall not just be used locally and shall use the network
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install cffi pynng
        ```
        
        > in case you are running on a RaspberryPi and want to access the GPIOs as inputs
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install RPi.GPIO
        ```
        
        > in case you are running on a RaspberryPi with an Adafruit Motor HAT
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install adafruit_motorkit
        ```
        
        - Install ft-Explore:
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install ftexplore
        ```
        
        - Run ft-Explore
        
        > run and show help page
        
        ```shell
        $ python -m ftexplore --help
        ```
        
        ### Clone (for developers only)
        
        - Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://www.hosting-srv.de/gitea/HNET/ftexplore.git`
        
        ---
        
        ## Features
        
        - Graphical user interface for controlling four motors/lights and showing the state of eight digital inputs
        - Platform independent, tested on Windows and Linux (Debian and Raspbian)
        - No dependencies except hardware drivers when operating locally
        - Controlling motors/lights and getting the state of the inputs can be done by user-provided Python scripts
        - The user-provided Python scripts can be executed and interrupted in the GUI. Script output and exceptions are shown there
        - Manual control via GUI and script-based control is possible simultaneously
        - GUI and hardware can be distributed to multiple machines, e.g. hardware on a headless RaspberryPi can be controlled via GUI on a Windows notebook
        
        ## Usage
        
        - Demo usage
        
        > Show GUI and use no real hardware for demo purposes (the default):
        
        ```shell
        $ python -m ftexplore
        ```
        
        > This is equivalent to
        
        ```shell
        $ python -m ftexplore --loglevel info --hardware demo
        ```
        
        In this mode, there is just emulated hardware. When you control the motors, depending on the direction of the motors the inputs are set.
        
        - Show GUI and use the locally available default hardware (Adafruit Motor HAT and eight RaspberryPi GPIOs as inputs)
        
        ```shell
        $ python -m ftexplore --hardware default
        ```
        
        Use this mode if you're working locally on a RaspberryPi with an Adafruit Motor HAT shield.0
        
        - Distributed operation with local GUI and remote hardware')
        
        > Listening side with the hardware (adapt port as needed)
        
        ```shell
        $ python -m ftexplore --hardware default --listen 2201
        ```
        > Client side with the GUI (adapt IP address and port as needed)
        
        ```shell
        $ python -m ftexplore --hardware 192.168.1.1:2201
        ```
        
        - Show help page for details on command line arguments
        
        ```shell
        $ python -m ftexplore --help
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        - src/ftexplore/eventprocessor
        
        This folder contains code for event processing and event distribution to the applications submodules. The application works by broadcasting events between the different application modules.
        
        - src/ftexplore/gui
        
        This folder contains the code for the graphical user interface. That interface is based on Tk.
        
        - src/ftexplore/hardware
        
        This folder contains modules to communicate with different types of hardware. A special hardware is "remote" hardware that resides on another machine and is accessed via network. Adapt the demo hardware to quickly implement support for your special hardware.
        
        - src/ftexplore/listener
        
        This folder contains the module that provides access to the local hardware via the network. One or more clients can be connected.
        
        - src/ftexplore/usercode 
        
        This folder contains the code controlling the execution of user-provided code.
