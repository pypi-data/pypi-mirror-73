Description: # Let Me Answer For You
        > A deep learning dialog system that answers specific and complex questions. 
        
        
         Built on top of the  [deeppavlov library](https://deeppavlov.ai/) 
        
        ## Pip Install
        
        The library can be found on **PyPI** so you can just run:
        ```
        pip install let_me_answer_for_you
        ```
        
        ## Simple Usage
        
        After the package is installed, download the file `chatbot.py` of the [GitHub](https://github.com/kikejimenez/let_me_answer_for_you) repository and run: 
        
        ```
        python chatbot.py
        ```
        
        After the installation process is finished,  the following interface appears:
        
        <img alt="Exporting from nbdev" width="800" caption="In this example neither the FAQ or context datasets have samples. After the first context is added, it appears as a reponse to the typed answer." src="nbs/images/context_spacex.gif">
        
        <img alt="Exporting from nbdev" width="800" caption="The example adds a new question-answer pair. The context of the first example also provides an answer." src="nbs/images/spacex_faq.gif">
        
        In the first example, neither the FAQ or context datasets have samples. After the first context is added, it appears as a reponse to the typed answer. The second example adds a new question-answer pair. The context of the first example also provides an answer.
        
        ## Technologies
        
        The Chatbot is based on two types of question/answer models:  
        
          1.   [Question Answering Model for SQuAD dataset](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/features/models/squad.html)  
          2.   [Knowledge Base Question Answering](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/features/models/kbqa.html)
        
        The first type of models can answer several questions from the same context, while the second type is very useful for specific and complex questions.
        It is strongly recommended to consult the [deeppavlov library](https://deeppavlov.ai/)  for further details of the available models for dialog systems.
        
        ## Structure of the  Package
        
        The package `let_me_answer_for_you` consists of three modules: [settings](/let_me_answer_for_you/settings), [dialog_system](/let_me_answer_for_you/dialog_system) and [chatbot](/let_me_answer_for_you/chatbot).
        
        The `chatbot.py` file of the repo, calls the `ChatBot` class in `chatbot` and is the child of the `DialogSystem` class in `dialog_system`. This last class  has the three main methods of the library:  
        
          1. [question_answering](/let_me_answer_for_you/dialog_system#DialogSystem.question_answer)
          2. [new_question_answer](/let_me_answer_for_you/dialog_system#DialogSystem.new_question_answer)
          3. [new_context](/let_me_answer_for_you/dialog_system#DialogSystem.new_context)
        
        The first method retrieves a set of answers for a given question. The second method adds a new question-answer pair to the FAQ data and retrains the model. The third method adds a new context to the context data. _These are the methods that may be exported as the API calls._
