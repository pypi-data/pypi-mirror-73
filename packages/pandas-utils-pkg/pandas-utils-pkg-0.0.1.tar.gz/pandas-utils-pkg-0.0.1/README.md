# pandas-utils-pkg
An open source library for pandas and MySQL/MariaDB.

## Prerequisite
Before you get started with the application code, here are some general tips and notes.

To work on this project, you will need : 
- **Docker** for the development environment.
- a text editor. **We strongly recommend that you use VsCode**. Indeed, the project uses Vscode's devcontainer which allows us to work in a Docker environment while having VsCode auto-completion.

## Installation
Once Docker and VsCode are installed, if not already installed, you can download the [Remote Development extension for VsCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). This extension will allow you to build and then launch the project.

## Good to know
You will note that our project is currently in alpha. We already use this library on our internal projects.

The project uses Pypi for installation.

We are open to participation on this project.
