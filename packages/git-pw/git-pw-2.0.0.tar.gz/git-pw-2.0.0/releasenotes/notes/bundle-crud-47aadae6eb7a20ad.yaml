    The following ``bundle`` commands have been added:

    - ``bundle create``
    - ``bundle update``
    - ``bundle delete``
    - ``bundle add``
    - ``bundle remove``

    Together, these allow for creation, modification and deletion of bundles.
    Bundles are custom, user-defined groups of patches that can be used to keep
    patch lists, preserving order, for future inclusion in a tree.

    These commands require API v1.2.
