    It's now possible to use a bundle name in addition to the numeric ID for
    the ``bundle download``, ``bundle apply`` and ``bundle show`` commands.
    For example::

        $ git pw bundle show 'My sample bundle'

    As bundle names are not necessarily unique, this will fail if multiple
    bundles match the provided string.
