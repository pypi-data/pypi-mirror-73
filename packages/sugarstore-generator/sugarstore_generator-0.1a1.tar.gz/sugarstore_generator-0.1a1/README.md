## Introduction

Sugar App Store is an app store to distribute apps
and games made for sugar, which are commonly known as sugar-activities.

### Install from PyPI
```bash
pip3 install sugarstore-generator
```

## Setup
* Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sugarlabs-appstore/sugarappstore
```
For a shallow clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sugarlabs-appstore/sugarappstore --depth=1
```

* Change directory to cloned directory
```bash
cd sugarappstore
```
* Run the program
```bash
python3 -m sugarstore_generator
```



## Minimal usage

Sugarlabs appstore generator (`sugarstore_generator`) is highly customizable. A sample usage and explanation have been provided below

### Pre-requisites

* A collection of Sugarlabs Activities in a dedicated folder. (The folder may contain other stuff). `sugarstore_generator` technically looks for `activity.info`, but not recursively. If the directory where you have clones is called `repo` (for example), then `sugarstore_generator` will only check `repo/**/activity/activity.info` exists.  If, it does not match the pattern, then the folder is ignored. We have avoided recursion through directories, due to the possibility of a longer build time, etc.
* `CPython 3.6+`, To build `python3` activities, you need `python3` executable in `PATH`. To support `python2` activities, you need `python2` on `PATH`.
* `git`executable, should be available in `PATH`
* (optional): `sugar-toolkit-gtk3`, `sugar-toolkit` (to build activities, i.e., to create bundle `.xo`)

> NOTE: Executable `python` is ambiguous. It has different implementations on different linux. So we prefer to stick to stricter executable names. i.e, `python2` or `python3`

### Simple Build Commands

1. To list all activities 

   ```bash
   python -m sugarstore_generator -i /path/to/repository --list-activities 
   ```

2. To build `.xo`

   ```bash
   python -m sugarstore_generator -i /path/to/repository -b
   ```

3. To create appstore

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sugarlabs-appstore/sugarappstore-static path/to/save/static/files
   python -m sugarstore_generator -i /path/to/repository -b -p path/to/save/static/files -o path/to/website/save/directory
   ```

### Parameters
* `-i INPUT_DIRECTORY`: is a directory containing cloned activities or unzipped bundles. 
                        If bundles are pre-generated, add the activity.info, place the bundles in `dist` directory as
                        convention
* `-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` : directory to output the website
* `-b --build-xo` : Iterate through all the directories as provided in the `INPUT_DIRECTORY` abd generate .xo
* `-g --generate-static-html` : compiles the information in `activity.info` to create HTML files

All sub-directories of bundles directory will be scanned for activity
bundles i.e. .xo files.

## TODO
- [x] Create search function js file, JSON data file & html page stitching them together
- [ ] NOTE: how will I ensure that results are presented in  some order when more than one search result is of equal standing in term of keywords match/ranking etc. Popularity/download counts or newest/last updated?
- [x] Python script to automatically add all apps to app store, generate html pages and append entry to JSON search index file.
- [x] Create demo website
- [x] Add copyright & license information
- [x] For production version, compress index.json file. Also use compressed version of jquery.
- [ ] in parent directory of website write a script to start static file server serving website sub-directory. This will be used when not using web server such as Nginx or Apache for acting as backend eg. a user can start server from usb stick.
- [x] in live website, a link to download entire website (as pre generated zip file?)

## Design choices

### Relative path of files instead of absolute
Since app store can be started just by opening index.html or any other html file in browser rather than first starting a server (even simple localhost one), keeping paths relative have advantage over absolute as they won't break and work even when any html file is opened directly in browser. One caveat will be that moving file from one directory to another will break its references. Script generating static pages need to keep this in mind i.e. must calculate references dynamically rather than hard coding them.

### CORS considerations
Since appstore is supposed to work even without starting a static file serving server i.e. by opening absolutely any HTML file in app store website directory, only way I found that nowadays browsers allow file to be loaded is when it's included by the HTML file opened itself. Files cannot be dynamically loaded later. This rules out all ajax calls in design of app store.

Thankfully, we can ask browser to defer loading of some files and wait for those files (search index) to be loaded. Instead of setting a asynchronous sleeping counter to check if search index is loaded, it's better if search index itself tell that it has loaded and we than perform any search in queue.

### jQuery framework
jQuery library is used as its lightweight and reduce a lot of code footprint (making project easy to maintain). Its more than enough as per our project requirement.

## Code guide
*Tip: if you don't have many activity bundles to test with than [download](https://github.com/tony37/Sugaractivities/archive/master.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/tony37/Sugaractivities.git) Tony's repo. It contains many (outdated) bundles in /activities directory.*

/generator/main.py (written as generator below) uses /website template to build website in /website directory.

generator takes two arguments
1. directory of bundles - Directory and all sub-directories are recursively scanned for .xo files
2. directory of website template - website will be generated in this directory
