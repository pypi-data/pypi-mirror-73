Description: Representing Constructible Numbers in Python
        ============================================
        
        Build Status: |Build Status|
        
        The constructible module provides exact representation of
        `constructible numbers`_ in Python.
        
        Python 2 and Python 3 are supported.
        
        The constructible numbers are the smallest field containing the rational numbers, where the square root of
        any non-negative constructible number is constructible as well. The non-negative constructible numbers are
        the lengths which can be constructed from the unit length using only a compass and a straightedge.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Usually the ``sqrt`` function is enough to work with constructible numbers::
        
            >>> from constructible import sqrt
            >>> x = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)
            >>> print(x)
            ((0 + 1 * sqrt(2)) + (1 + 0 * sqrt(2)) * sqrt((3 + 0 * sqrt(2))))
            >>> y = x*x
            >>> print(y)
            ((5 + 0 * sqrt(2)) + (0 + 2 * sqrt(2)) * sqrt((3 + 0 * sqrt(2))))
            >>> z = y*y
            >>> t = 10*y - z
            >>> t == 1
            True
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install from PYPI just type ::
        
            pip install constructible
        
        The library is a single pure python file, so it is also easy to install by hand.
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        There are some tests using ``unittest``. Thanks to `Travis-CI`_ each push to github triggers a test:

        Releasing on PYPI
        ------------------
        
        The following steps are needed:
        
        -  make sure .pypirc is up to date::
        
               [distutils]
               index-servers =
                 pypi
                 pypitest
        
               [pypi]
               repository=https://pypi.org/legacy/
               username=xxx
               password=xxx
        
               [pypitest]
               repository=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
               username=xxx
               password=xxx
        
        -  Update the version in setup.py
        -  Tag the version in git::
        
               git tag 0.1 -m "Adds a tag so that we can put this on PyPI."
               git push --tags origin
        
        -  Test release with::
        
               python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest
        
        -  Productive release with::
        
             python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi

        Aknowledgements
        ---------------
        
        Thanks to `Anders Kaseorg`_ whose
        `implementation of constructible numbers in Haskell`_
        provided inspiration and in particular the
        `algorithm for taking square roots`_
        in quadratic extension fields.
