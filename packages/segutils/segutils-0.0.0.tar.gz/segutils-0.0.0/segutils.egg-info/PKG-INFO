Description: # segutils
        Common utilities for image processing, segmentation, and detection.
        
        ## About
        This library contains many useful utilities for image processing, mostly for preprocessing and visualizations for
        computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation. These utilities aim to have a flowing and unified
        API in order to make the transition between the different stages data handling during these tasks.   
        
        ## Install
        `$ pip install segutils`
        
        ## The Mission
        There are many utilities out there for handling performing preprocessing and visualizations for computer vision tasks.
        Most of these utilities are scattered among many different tools found all over the web, and the rest are incomplete
        gist files and small repositories which are always lacking, none of which are on PyPi. The mission is to make a
        unified toolkit for all of these tools that will follow one API logic and sensible defaults and put an end to
        proprietary visualization code.
        
        Contributions are all welcome. There is much work to be done.
