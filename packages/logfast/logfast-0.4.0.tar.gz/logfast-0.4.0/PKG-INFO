Description: # Logfast
        
        ## Purpose
        Just a simple python package which does logging initialization in a certain way.
        
        ```
        17|12|19|00:18:58|+0100  14474:MainThread  INFO       |__init__.py.21  |   This is an example
        17|12|19|00:18:58|+0100  14474:MainThread  WARNING    |__init__.py.22  |   Another one
        ```
        As one can see it provides the filename where the log has been created, the Process ID
        , the Thread Name, and the full time (including).
        This is a package I created for my own benefit, as i found myself tired of always doing the same logging initalization.
        
        Now i can just ```pip install logfast``` wherever i am. 
        
        Most likely you will want to a have different logging format than me(so this package might be of no use to you).
        But if you want the same format feel free to use it.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```pip install logfast```
        
        ## Usage Guide
        Make sure this is the first module you import in your application.
        This makes sure no other call is made first to logging.
        Otherwise other modules/libraries might overwrite the logging settings.
        This allows you to have multiple application entrypoints but have the same logging configuration.
        
        ```
        import logfast
        
        logger = logfast.getLogger()
        
        
        logger.info("This is an example")
        logger.warning("Another one")
        ```
