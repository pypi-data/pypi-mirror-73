        Explanation and suggestions:
        City "londo" was misspelled. It was assumed as "London" in United Kingdom.
        Maybe you meant next options: "East London" in South Africa, "Londolozi Private Game Reserve" in South Africa, "London" in Canada, "New London" in United States
        ```
        
        ### Options:
        ```Shell
          -f, --from TEXT         Departure City  [required]
        
          -t, --to TEXT           Destination City (can be multiple)  [required]
        
          -a, --all-destinations  Shows flights for every destination. 
                                  (default - shows only the best destination)
        
          -e, --explain-result    If entered cities were misspelled, then it explains
                                  what cities were searched and suggests correct city
                                  name options
        ```
