        Translations
        ------------
        
        This product has been translated into
        
        - German (MrTango)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install plone.gallery by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                plone.gallery
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Please make sure that you have reasonable image sizes set in your portal. Something as follow should be good.
        
            large 1400:1400
            preview 600:600
            mini 400:400
            thumb 200:200
        
        The large size is used for the zoom and mini for the preview grid view.
        Changing the other too just make sense if you change something.
        
        After you have the correct sizes, you can just change the view on every Folder or Collection in Plone to "Photo gallerie".
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - add some more tests for the view
        - make flexbin-row-height and flexbin-space configureable
