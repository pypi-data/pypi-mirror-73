Description: gu-bi-dist is a Python module for machine learning,and distributed under the MIT open license. The prime functionality of module is to measure Gaussian and Binomial distribution's mean, standard deviation, and PDF(Probability Density Function).
        The module also supports data and PDF visualization, source code is available at the bottom of the page.

        Gaussian distribution:
        In probability theory, a normal (or Gaussian or Gauss or Laplace–Gauss) distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. For more details visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution
        
        Binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own boolean-valued outcome: success/yes/true/one (with probability p) or failure/no/false/zero (with probability q = 1 − p).
