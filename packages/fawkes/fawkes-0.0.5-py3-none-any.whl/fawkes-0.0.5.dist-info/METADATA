# Fawkes

Fawkes is a privacy protection system developed by researchers at University of Chicago. For more information about the project, please refer to our project [webpage](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/).  

We published an academic paper to summary our work "[Fawkes: Protecting Personal Privacy against Unauthorized Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08327.pdf)" at *USENIX Security 2020*.
