To interact with Overleaf, you must provide the email address and password that you use to log into your Overleaf account.
This will be used to authenticate you when syncing with Overleaf.

We'll save these to an untracked file locally at `output/untracked/overleaf/credentials.json`. This file will not
get synced and collaborators will have to enter their own Overleaf email and password if they want to update the
Overleaf Project. It is safe to delete this file, you'll just be prompted again for you credentials when needed.
