This Gigantum Project is not yet linked to an Overleaf project.
To do this, you must be able to use git based syncing, available with paid Overleaf plans. Note, this requirement is
only on the *owner* of the project. You can learn more about Git and Overleaf here:
https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_push_a_new_project_to_Overleaf_via_git%3F.

To start, get the 'git link' for the desired Overleaf Project:

  1. Open the project on Overleaf
  2. Click on the Overleaf Menu button at the top left corner
  3. Under the 'Sync' section, click on 'Git'
  4. Copy the url that looks something like 'https://git.overleaf.com/abcdef0123456789abcdef01'
