This Overleaf project has been linked to a Gigantum Project using the `gigaleaf` library. When
outputs are updated in Gigantum and synced, they will automatically appear here. You can learn
more about `gigaleaf` here: https://github.com/gigantum/gigaleaf

To use the subfiles that are automatically generated by gigaleaf, you must add the following to
the preamble of your main.tex file:

  % gigaleaf setup
  \usepackage[export]{adjustbox} % Needed if linking image files
  \usepackage{graphicx} % Needed if linking image files
  \graphicspath{{gigantum/data/}{../data/}} % Needed if linking image files. If you already have this, update existing
  \usepackage{csvsimple} % Needed if linking csv files
  \usepackage{float} % Needed if linking csv files
  \restylefloat{table} % Needed if linking csv files
  \usepackage{booktabs} % Needed if linking dataframe files
  \usepackage{subfiles} % Best loaded last in the preamble
  % gigaleaf setup


You can then use the subfiles with the following format:

  \subfile{gigantum/subfiles/<filename>_<extension>}

for example if the output file being tracked was `fig1.png`, this would be:

  \subfile{gigantum/subfiles/fig1_png}


There is some automatic filename sanitation, so you can see the exact subfile filenames in gigantum/subfiles
in this Overleaf project.
