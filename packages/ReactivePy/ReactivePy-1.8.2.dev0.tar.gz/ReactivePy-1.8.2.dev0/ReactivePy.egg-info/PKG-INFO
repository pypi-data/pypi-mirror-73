Description: # ReactivePy
        
        A simple library to manage reactive properties within an object using custom descriptors and update methods.
        
        ## About ReactivePy
        
        ReactivePy lets you create objects that contain reactive properties. Those can be updated in bulk, which allows ReactivePy to notify its observers of changes. The callback can then read the history, update value as well as the name of the attribute.
        
        ```python
        from reactive import ReactiveOwner, ReactiveProperty
        
        class Foo(ReactiveOwner):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                self.name = ReactiveProperty("Foo")
                self.age = ReactiveProperty(6)
        
        foo = Foo()
        
        def on_change(*args):
            for arg in args: print(arg.name, "updated to", arg)
        
        def on_name_change(curr: Any, org: Any):
            print("Name updated from", org, "to", curr)
        
        foo.on_change(on_update, foo.name, foo.age)
        foo.name.on_change(on_name_update)
        
        foo._bulk_update({"name": "name", "value": "Bar"},
                          {"name": "age", "value": 12})
        ```
        
        Reactive properties can also be strong-typed raising a `TypeError` if the value they're being set to doesn't match the `field_type` defined in the constructor. Strong-typing a property looks like this:
        
        ```python
        class Foo(ReactiveOwner):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                self.name = ReactiveProperty("Foo", field_type=str)
        ```
        
        ### `all_reactive` Decorator
        
        The `ReactiveOwner.all_reactive` owner can be used on classes, where all public attributes should be reactive, which will additionally override the `__setattr__` method to convert any attribute writes.
        
        Classes using the `ReactiveOwner.all_reactive` decorator do not need to inherit from `ReactiveOwner`:
        
        ```python
        from reactive import all_reactive
        
        @all_reactive
        class Foo:
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                self.name = "Foo"
        ```
        
        Additionally the parameters `only_type` and `not_type` can be specified, as a single type, list or tuple of types which will have only those types converted to `class ReactiveProperty` or not.
        
        ### Using Type `bool`
        
        Since the type `bool` cannot be used as a base class, when retrieving its value, users must explicitly use `ReactiveProperty.value` attribute:
        
        ```python
        from reactive import ReactiveOwner, ReactiveProperty
        
        class Foo(ReactiveOwner):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
                self.boolean = ReactiveProperty(True)
        
        foo = Foo()
        print(foo.boolean.value)
        
        # >>> True
        ```
