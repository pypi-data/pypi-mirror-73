Go to Sales > Configuration > Sale orders > Preferred Shipping Methods to
define new Preferred Shipping Methods.

A Preferred Shipping Method can either define a specific Delivery Method or
use the partner's defined Delivery Method.

These Preferred Shipping Methods will then be filtered out according to the
order's shipping weight.
