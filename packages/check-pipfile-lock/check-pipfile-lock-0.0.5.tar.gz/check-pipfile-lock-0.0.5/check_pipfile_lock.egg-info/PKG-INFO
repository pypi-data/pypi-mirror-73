        This package bridges gab in pipenv tooling by providing
        quick and easy way to check whether Pipfile.lock in question
        is consistent with the corresponding Pipfile without doing
        anything else.
        
        I find it particularly useful with pre-commit hooks (see below)
        
        Usage
        -----
        ::
        
          check-pipfile-lock <path to Pipfile.lock>
        
        If no path to ``Pipfile.lock`` is provided, the current
        directory is assumed.
        
        Pre-commit hook
        ---------------
        Here is the configuration for
        `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ framework.
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
          - repo: https://github.com/haizaar/check-pipfile-lock
            rev: v0.0.5
            hooks:
              - id: check-pipfile-lock
        
        Development
        -----------
        .. code-block:: shell
        
          echo 'layout pipenv' > .envrc
          direnv allow  # will take a while
          make bootstrap
