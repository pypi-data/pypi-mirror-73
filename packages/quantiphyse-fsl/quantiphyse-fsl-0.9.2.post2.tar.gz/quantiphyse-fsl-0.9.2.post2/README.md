FSL plugin for Quantiphyse
==========================

This plugin provides a Quantiphyse interface to selected FSL
tools, currently:

  - BET
  - FAST
  - FLIRT/MCFLIRT (via the registration widget)
  - FSL_ANAT (experimental)
  - Atlasses/standard data

Quantiphyse and FSL must be installed. Note that this plugin is
an interface only and contains no FSL code itself!
To install the plugin from PyPi use:

    pip install quantiphyse-fsl

The plugin will then be available from within Quantiphyse
