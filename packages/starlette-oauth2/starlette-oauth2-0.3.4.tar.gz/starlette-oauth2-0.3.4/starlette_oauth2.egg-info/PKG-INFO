Description: # Starlette OAuth2
        
        A Startlette middleware for authentication through oauth2's via a secret key, which is often used to add authentication and authorization to a web application that interacts with an API on behalf of the user.
        
        This middleware is intented to be used when the application relies on an external tenant (e.g. Microsoft AD) for authentication.
        
        Check `example/` for a concrete implementation.
        
        ## How to run the example against Microsoft AD
        
        Note: the values in capital such as `CLIENT_ID` are to be added to `example/.venv`.
        
        1. Generate a secret (e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`) and write its value on `SECRET_KEY`
        
        2. Go to Azure AD, create an app registration (`app registrations`), give it a name, and add `http://localhost:5001/authorized` as a `Redirect URI`.
            * add the value on `Application (client) ID` to `CLIENT_ID`
            * add the value on `Endpoints > OpenID Connect metadata document` to `SERVER_METADATA_URL`
        
        3. In `Certificates & secrets` tab, create a new client secret.
            * add the value of the key you just created under `Client secrets` to `CLIENT_SECRET`
        
        4. Install dependencies and run:
        
        ```
        cd example
        python -m venv venv
        venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
        venv/bin/python -m app
        ```
        
        When you visit `http://localhost:5001/public`, you will see that you are not authenticated.
        When you visit `http://localhost:5001/other`, you will be redirected to your tenant, to authenticate. Once authenticated, you will be redirected back to `http://localhost:5001/other`, and your email will appear.
        
        Public endpoints are optional. They are useful for e.g. health checks.
