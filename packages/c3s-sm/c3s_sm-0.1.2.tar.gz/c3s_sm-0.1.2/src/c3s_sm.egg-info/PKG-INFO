        Installation
        ============
        
        Setup of a complete environment with `conda
        <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ can be performed using the following
        commands:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
          git clone git@github.com:TUW-GEO/c3s_sm.git c3s_sm
          cd c3s_sm
          conda env create -f environment.yml
          source activate c3s_sm
        
        Supported Products
        ==================
        
        At the moment this package supports C3S soil moisture data
        in netCDF format (reading and time series creation)
        with a spatial sampling of 0.25 degrees.
        
        Contribute
        ==========
        
        We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining what
        is missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requests
        against our master branch for new features or bug fixes.
        
        Development setup
        -----------------
        
        For Development we also recommend a ``conda`` environment. You can create one
        including test dependencies and debugger by running
        ``conda env create -f environment.yml``. This will create a new ``c3s_sm``
        environment which you can activate by using ``source activate c3s_sm``.
        
        Guidelines
        ----------
        
        If you want to contribute please follow these steps:
        
        - Fork the c3s_sm repository to your account
        - Clone the repository, make sure you use ``git clone --recursive`` to also get
          the test data repository.
        - make a new feature branch from the c3s_sm master branch
        - Add your feature
        - Please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories.
          We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
        - submit a pull request to our master branch
