Contributing to Sherpa development
==================================

.. todo::

   Needs work.
   
Contributions to Sherpa - whether it be bug reports,
documentation updates, or new code - are highly encouraged.

At present we do not have any explicit documentation on how
to contribute to Sherpa, but it is similar to other open-source
packages such as
`AstroPy <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html#contributing>`_.

The developer documentation is also currently lacking.
