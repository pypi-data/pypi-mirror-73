        Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.
        
        `cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, GitHub Actions and CircleCI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.

        <sup>² Beta support until Travis CI fixes <a href="https://travis-ci.community/t/no-space-left-on-device-for-system-z/5954/11">a bug</a></sup><br>
        <sup>³ Python 3.9 is not yet ABI stable, so you shouldn't publish wheels with it yet. But if you want to check that your wheels build on Python 3.9, try our [`python3.9` branch](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/pull/382)!</sup>
        
        - Builds manylinux, macOS and Windows wheels for CPython and PyPy using Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI
        - Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
        - Runs the library test suite against the wheel-installed version of your library
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        `cibuildwheel` currently works on **Travis CI**, **Azure Pipelines**, **AppVeyor** and **GitHub Actions** to build wheels for all three supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). On **CircleCI** Linux and macOS wheels can be built.
        
        |                 | Linux | macOS | Windows |

        `cibuildwheel` is not intended to run on your development machine. Because it uses system Python from Python.org it will try to install packages globally - not what you expect from a build tool! Instead, isolated CI services like Travis CI, CircleCI, Azure Pipelines and AppVeyor are ideal.

        Example setup
        -------------
        
        To build manylinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on Travis CI and upload them to PyPI whenever you tag a version, you could use this `.travis.yml`:
        
        ```yaml
        language: python
        
        jobs:
          include:
            # perform a linux build
            - services: docker
            # and a mac build
            - os: osx
              language: shell
            # and a windows build
            - os: windows
              language: shell
              before_install:
                - choco install python --version 3.8.0
                - export PATH="/c/Python38:/c/Python38/Scripts:$PATH"
        
        env:
          global:
            - TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
            # Note: TWINE_PASSWORD is set to a PyPI API token in Travis settings
        
        install:
          - python3 -m pip install cibuildwheel==1.5.2
        
        script:
          # build the wheels, put them into './wheelhouse'
          - python3 -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        
        after_success:
          # if the release was tagged, upload them to PyPI
          - |
            if [[ $TRAVIS_TAG ]]; then
              python3 -m pip install twine
              python3 -m twine upload wheelhouse/*.whl
            fi
        ```

        Legal note
        ----------
        
        Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.
        
        It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.
        
        This is similar to static linking, so it might have some licence implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

          some requirements formats were used. (#401)
        - 🛠 Update CPython 3.7 to 3.7.8 (#394)
        
        ### 1.5.1
        
        _25 June 2020_
        
        - 🐛 Fix "OSError: [WinError 17] The system cannot move the file to a different

        ### 1.5.0
        
        _24 June 2020_
        
        - 🌟 Add [`CIBW_BEFORE_ALL`](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#before-all)
          option, which lets you run a command on the build machine before any wheels
          are built. This is especially useful when building on Linux, to `make`
          something external to Python, or to `yum install` a dependency. (#342)
        - ✨ Added support for projects using pyproject.toml instead of setup.py
          (#360, #358)
        - ✨ Added workaround to allow Python 3.5 on Windows to pull dependencies from
          pyproject.toml. (#358)
        - 📚 Improved Github Actions examples and docs (#354, #362)
        - 🐛 Ensure pip wheel uses the specified package, and doesn't build a wheel
          from PyPI (#369)
        - 🛠 Internal changes: using pathlib.Path, precommit hooks, testing
          improvements.
        
        ### 1.4.2
        
        _25 May 2020_
        
        - 🛠 Dependency updates, including CPython 3.8.3 & manylinux images.
        - 🛠 Lots of internal updates - type annotations and checking using mypy, and
          a new integration testing system.
        - ⚠️ Removed support for *running* cibuildwheel using Python 3.5. cibuildwheel
          will continue to build Python 3.5 wheels until EOL.
        
        ### 1.4.1
        
        _4 May 2020_
        
        - 🐛 Fix a bug causing programs running inside the i686 manylinux images to
          think they were running x86_64 and target the wrong architecture. (#336,
          #338)
        
        ### 1.4.0
        
        _2 May 2020_
        
        - 🌟 Deterministic builds. cibuildwheel now locks the versions of the tools it
          uses. This means that pinning your version of cibuildwheel pins the versions
          of pip, setuptools, manylinux etc. that are used under the hood. This should
          make things more reliable. But note that we don't control the entire build
          environment on macOS and Windows, where the version of Xcode and Visual
          Studio can still effect things.
        
          This can be controlled using the [CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#dependency-versions)
          and [manylinux image](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#manylinux-image)
          options - if you always want to use the latest toolchain, you can still do
          that, or you can specify your own pip constraints file and manylinux image.
          (#256)
        - ✨ Added `package_dir` command line option, meaning we now support building
          a package that lives in a subdirectory and pulls in files from the wider
          project. See [the `package_dir` option help](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#command-line-options)
          for more information.
        
          Note that this change makes the working directory (where you call
          cibuildwheel from) relevant on Linux, as it's considered the 'project' and
          will be copied into the Docker container. If your builds are slower on this
          version, that's likely the reason. `cd` to your project and then call
          `cibuildwheel` from there. (#319, #295)
        - 🛠 On macOS, we make `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` default to `10.9` if it's
          not set. This should make things more consistent between Python versions.
        - 🛠 Dependency updates - CPython 3.7.7, CPython 2.7.18, Pypy 7.3.1.
        
        ### 1.3.0
        
        _12 March 2020_
        
        - 🌟 Add support for building on Github Actions! Check out the
          [docs](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/#github-actions)
          for information on how to set it up. (#194)
        - ✨ Add the `CIBW_BEFORE_TEST` option, which lets you run a command to
          prepare the environment before your tests are run. (#242)
        
        ### 1.2.0
        
        _8 March 2020_
        
        - 🌟 Add support for building PyPy wheels, across Manylinux, macOS, and
          Windows. (#185)
        - 🌟 Added the ability to build ARM64 (aarch64), ppc64le, and s390x wheels,
          using manylinux2014 and Travis CI. (#273)
        - ✨ You can now build macOS wheels on Appveyor. (#230)
        - 🛠 Changed default macOS minimum target to 10.9, from 10.6. This allows the
          use of more modern C++ libraries, among other things. (#156)
        - 🛠 Stop building universal binaries on macOS. We now only build x86_64
          wheels on macOS. (#220)
        - ✨ Allow chaining of commands using `&&` and `||` on Windows inside
          CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD and CIBW_TEST_COMMAND. (#293)
        - 🛠 Improved error reporting for failed Cython builds due to stale .so files
          (#263)
        - 🛠 Update CPython from 3.7.5 to 3.7.6 and from 3.8.0 to 3.8.2 on Mac/Windows
        - 🛠 Improved error messages when a bad config breaks cibuildwheel's PATH
          variable. (#264)
        - ⚠️ Removed support for *running* cibuildwheel on Python 2.7. cibuildwheel
          will continue to build Python 2.7 wheels for a little while. (#265)
        
        ### 1.1.0
        
        _7 December 2019_
        
        - 🌟 Add support for building manylinux2014 wheels. To use, set
          `CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE` and CIBW_MANYLINUX_I686_IMAGE to
          `manylinux2014`.
        - ✨ Add support for [Linux on Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2018/03/06/appveyor-for-linux/) (#204, #207)
        - ✨ Add `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND` env variable, for changing how
          `auditwheel` or `delocate` are invoked, or testing an equivalent on
          Windows. (#211)
        - 📚 Added some travis example configs - these are available in /examples. (#228)
        
        ### 1.0.0
        
        _10 November 2019_
        
        - 🌟 Add support for building Python 3.8 wheels! (#180)
        - 🌟 Add support for building manylinux2010 wheels. cibuildwheel will now
          build using the manylinux2010 images by default. If your project is still
          manylinux1 compatible, you should get both manylinux1 and manylinux2010
          wheels - you can upload both to PyPI. If you always require manylinux1 wheels, you can
          build using the old manylinux1 image using the [manylinux image](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#manylinux-image) option.
          (#155)
        - 📚 Documentation is now on its [own mini-site](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io),
           rather than on the README (#169)
        - ✨ Add support for building Windows wheels on Travis CI. (#160)
        - 🛠 If you set `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND`, your tests now run in a virtualenv. (#164)
        - 🛠 Windows now uses Python as installed by nuget, rather than the versions
          installed by the various CI providers. (#180)
        - 🛠 Update Python from 2.7.16 to 2.7.17 and 3.7.4 to 3.7.5 on macOS (#171)
        - ⚠️ Removed support for Python 3.4 (#168)
        
        ### 0.12.0
        
        _29 September 2019_
        
        - ✨ Add CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS option, to allow testing using extra_require
          options. For example, set `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS=test,qt` to make the wheel
          installed with `pip install <wheel_file>[test,qt]`
        - 🛠 Update Python from 3.7.2 to 3.7.4 on macOS
        - 🛠 Update OpenSSL patch to 1.0.2t on macOS
        
        ### 0.11.1
        
        _28 May 2019_
        
        - 🐛 Fix missing file in the release tarball, that was causing problems with

          Linux, Mac and Windows wheels on one service, so it promises to be the
          easiest to set up! Check out the quickstart in the docs, or
          [cibuildwheel-azure-example](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel-azure-example)
          for an example project. (#126, #132)
        - 🛠 Internal change - the end-to-end test projects format was updated, so we
          can more precisely assert what should be produced for each one. (#136, #137).

        _7 September 2017_
        
        - ✨ `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT` added. You can now set environment variables for each build, even within the Docker container on Linux. This is a big one! (#21)
        - ✨ `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD` now runs in a system shell on all platforms. You can now do things like `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD="cmd1 && cmd2"`. (#32)
        
        ### 0.4.1
        
        _14 August 2017_
        
        - 🐛 Fixed a bug on Windows where subprocess' output was hidden (#23)
        - 🐛 Fixed a bug on AppVeyor where logs would appear in the wrong order due to output buffering (#24, thanks @YannickJadoul!)

        _23 July 2017_
        
        - 🐛 Fixed a bug that was increasing the build time by building the wheel twice. This was a problem for large projects that have a long build time. If you're upgrading and you need the old behaviour, use `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD={pip} install .`, or install exactly the dependencies you need in `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD`. See #18.
        
        ### 0.3.0
        
        _27 June 2017_

        ### 0.2.1
        
        _11 June 2017_
        
        - 🛠 Changed the build process to install the package before building the wheel - this allows direct dependencies to be installed first (#9, thanks @tgarc!)
        - ✨ Added Python 3 support for the main process, for systems where Python 3 is the default (#8, thanks @tgarc).
        
        ### 0.2.0
        
        _13 April 2017_
        
        - ✨ Added `CIBW_SKIP` option, letting users explicitly skip a build
        - ✨ Added `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD` option, letting users run a shell command before the build starts
        
        ### 0.1.3
        
        _31 March 2017_
        
        - 🌟 First public release!

        ========
        
        If you'd like to keep wheel building separate from the package itself, check out [astrofrog/autowheel](https://github.com/astrofrog/autowheel). It builds packages using cibuildwheel from source distributions on PyPI.
        
        If `cibuildwheel` is too limited for your needs, consider [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It can do a lot more than this project - it's used to build SciPy!
