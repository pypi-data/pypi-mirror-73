# NIDDK SICR Model for estimating SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population

Code and data used for Chow et al, ["Global prediction of unreported SARS-CoV2 infection from observed COVID-19 cases"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20083485v1), to model the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic and estimate the unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infected population from reported cases, case recoveries, and case deaths globablly.  Models are implemented in Stan and fit using PyStan.

The core model is a variation of the SIR model with a latent variable `I` for the number of *unobserved* infected which is distinguished from `C` the *observed* cases.  This model follows:

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{dS}{dt}=-\frac{\beta}{N}S(I%2BqC))

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{dI}{dt}=\frac{\beta}{N}S(I%2BqC)-\sigma_CI-\sigma_UI)

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{dC}{dt}=\sigma_CI-\sigma_RC-\sigma_DC)

Several variants of this model are discussed in the Supplemental Material of the preprint.  The code required to fit these models to data is provided in the `models` directory. Data sources include The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) and The COVID Tracking Project.

### Requirements to run code here:
- python 3.5+
- Install the Python package:
  - From pypi: `pip install covid-sicr`
  - Or from source:
    - `git clone http://github.com/nih-niddk-mbs/covid-sicr`
    - `cd covid-sicr`
    - `pip install -e .  # This installs the covid-sicr package from source`
  - Or place this directory in your `PYTHONPATH` and install the contents of `requirements.txt`. 
- `pystan` may not be easily pip installable on some systems, so consider conda:
  - `conda install -c conda-forge pystan`

### Important scripts:
- New data can be downloaded from data sources with `scripts/get-data.py`:
  - For all data sources: `python scripts/get-data.py`.
  - This will use Johns Hopkins and COVID Tracking by default.  
  - Other options can be seen with the `--help` flag.
  - Data sources follow a functional pattern and are extensible.

- Stan models can be run with Python file `scripts/run.py`:
  - Run a single region with:
    - `python scripts/run.py MODEL_NAME --roi=REGION_NAME`
    - e.g. `python scripts/run.py SICRLMQ --roi=US_MI`
  - Other optional arguments for specifying paths and some fitting parameters can be examined with `python scripts/run.py --help`.
  - A pickle file containing the resultant fit will be produced in your `fits-path` (see help).
  - A `scripts/run-many.py` file is provided for reference but much better performance will be obtained by running `scripts/run.py` on a cluster.

- Analyze finished fits for all regions with `scripts/visualize.py`:
  - For all regions (with fits) with `python scripts/visualize.py MODEL_NAME`
  - e.g. `python visualize-master.py --nonlinearmodel`
  - As above, help is available with the `--help` flag.
  - Jupyter notebooks containining all analyzed regions will be created in your `--fits-path`.

- Tables summarizing fit parameters can be generated with `scripts/make-tables.py`:
  - `python scripts/make-tables.py`
  - e.g. `python scripts/make-tables.py --model-names nonlinearmodel fulllinearmodel`
  - As above, help is available with the `--help` flag.
  - `.csv` files of the resulting dataframes will be created in the `--fit-path` directory in the `tables` subdirectory.
  
Reproducbility of a particular version of the manuscript will require using a particular tag, e.g. ["medrXiv-v1"](https://github.com/nih-niddk-mbs/covid-sicr/tree/medRxiv-v1) (see tags and releases here).  Using the most recent version of any other branch (including master) may lead to different results as our research is on-going.
