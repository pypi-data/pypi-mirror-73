## Request Logging for WSGI Web Applications

This is a middleware which you can use to log requests to your WSGI based site.
It's even imitating Apache's combined log format to allow you to use any of the
many tools for Apache log file analysis.

By making use of Python's standard library logging facilities, you can easily set it up to log to STDOUT, time rotated log files, email, syslog, etc.

#### Installation

Simply install this Python module via

    pip install wsgi-request-logger

#### Usage

To add this middleware to your WSGI `application` and log to the file *access.log*, do:

    from requestlogger import WSGILogger, ApacheFormatter
    from logging.handlers import TimedRotatingFileHandler
    
    def application(environ, start_response):
        response_body = 'The request method was %s' % environ['REQUEST_METHOD']
        response_body = response_body.encode('utf-8')
        response_headers = [('Content-Type', 'text/plain'),
                            ('Content-Length', str(len(response_body)))]
        start_response('200 OK', response_headers)
        return [response_body]
    
    handlers = [ TimedRotatingFileHandler('access.log', 'd', 7) , ]
    loggingapp = WSGILogger(application, handlers, ApacheFormatter())
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
        http = make_server('', 8080, loggingapp)
        http.serve_forever()

#### The Authors

This WSGI middleware was originally developed under the name [wsgilog](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wsgilog/) by  **L. C. Rees**.
It was forked by **Philipp Klaus** in 2013 to build a WSGI middleware for request logging rather than exception handling and logging.
