# Modes 1.0.2

Photonic mode solver with a nice interface and output.

* semi-vectorial and fully vectorial options,
* simple structure drawing,
* automated data saving and plotting via Matplotlib
* some limited (at this stage) data processing (finding MFD of fundamental mode), and
* easily extensible library

The documentation for this project can be found [here](http://modes.rtfd.io).

## Examples

Take a look at the jupyter notebooks

## Installation

You can install modes via `pip install modes`

## Acknowledgments

This finite difference mode solver is based on a modified version of [EMpy](https://github.com/lbolla/EMpy).
This project is a fork of [modesolverpy](https://github.com/jtambasco/modesolverpy)
