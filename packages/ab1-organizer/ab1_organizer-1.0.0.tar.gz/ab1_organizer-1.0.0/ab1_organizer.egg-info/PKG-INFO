Description: # ab1_organizer
        
        ## Goal
        
        Organize AB1 files by researches and primer-pairs.
        
        ## Instalation
        
        For command line usage, simpleously use pip way:
        
        ```bash
        
        pip install ab1_organizer
        
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        `ab1_organizer` receive two arguments on initialization: the results file from Macrogen sequencing (-f, --file argument) and the modified order table (-t, --table argument). The sequencing file consists of the raw zipfile (file-name.zip) containing all .ab1, .pdf, phd.1, and .txt files. The order file consists of a simple excel table containing Macrogen order specifications and containing standardized headers (see next section).
        
        ### Standardized headers
        
        Your table would contain almost four columns, named respectively:
        - sampleName: The unique identifier of sample;
        - primerName: The primer name. e.g. "CO3 F", or "ITS1 R";
        - personInCharge: The name of a person or a project responsible for the sample processing;
        - primerCombination: Underscore separated complementary primer names. As example, if some region are sequenced using the "ITS1-F" and "ITS1-R", the primerCombination would be "ITS1-F_ITS1-R".
        
        
        At the terminal, run the code:
        
        ```bash
        
        ab1_organizer.py -f ./path/to/zip/file -t ./path/to/order/table.xlsx
        
        ```
        
        A new folder with the same name of the zip file will be created and all files will be organized by author and genomic marker respectively.
