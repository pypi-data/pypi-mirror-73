1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Support Vector Regression
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression
7. Adaboost Regression

You need to specify all the hyperparameters for each of these classes as is given in the sklearn documentation.

Avail the benefit of imporrting the regression classes at once and play with them to see the best fit model for your regression problem.

Hope it helps to solve your problem.
