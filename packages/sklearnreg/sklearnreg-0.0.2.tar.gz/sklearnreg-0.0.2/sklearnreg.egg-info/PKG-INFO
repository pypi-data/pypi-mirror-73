Description: This is a library that imports all the classes of sklearn regression model. The list of classes that are imported within this model include:
        1. Linear Regression
        2. Ridge Regression
        3. Lasso Regression
        4. Support Vector Regression
        5. Decision Tree Regression
        6. Random Forest Regression
        7. Adaboost Regression
        
        You need to specify all the hyperparameters for each of these classes as is given in the sklearn documentation.
        
        Avail the benefit of imporrting the regression classes at once and play with them to see the best fit model for your regression problem.
