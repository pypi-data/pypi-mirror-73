pythonGraph
===========

pythonGraph is a simple graphics package for Python. Its design is loosely
descended from Adagraph and RAPTOR Graph. pythonGraph supports the creation of
a graphics window, the display of simple geometric shapes, and simple user
interactions using the mouse and keyboard.

pythonGraph is designed for introductory programming courses, allowing students
to create a graphical user interface with minimal complexity.
