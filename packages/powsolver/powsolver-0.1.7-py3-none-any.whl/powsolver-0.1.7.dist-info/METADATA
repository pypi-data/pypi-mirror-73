A proof of work puzzle solver mainly for CTF challenges and whatnot.


## Getting Started

You can get started using `powsolver` by installing it through pip.

```
pip install powsolver
```

## Usage

The main component of the powsolver package is the `PoWSolver` class which encapsulates the main functionality.

Here is a basic usage example of the powsolver:

```python
from powsovler import PoWSolver

solver = PoWSolver()
solver.parse(
    "Please submit a printable string X, such that {alg}(X)[{start:d}:] = {target} and len(X) = {len}",
    "Please submit a printable string X, such that sha256(X)[-6:] = 86d113 and len(X) = 11"
)
sol = solver.sol()
```

Exampled of more elaborated usage can be found in the [examples](./examples/)  folder.
