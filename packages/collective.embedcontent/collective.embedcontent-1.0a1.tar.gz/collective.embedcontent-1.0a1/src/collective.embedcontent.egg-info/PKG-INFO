        =======================
        collective.embedcontent
        =======================
        
        Collective.embed provides a way to install a zip or single html file of content into a plone site. 
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Content is displayed inside an iframe in a content view or in a mosaic tile.
        
        - Content is not filtered like pasted html in the visual editor. This allows for
          - subsites authored by other tools such newsletter software. Linked html works but need to be relative.
          - social media JS embed codes
        
        Notes
        -----
        - Note this does increase the likelyhood of harmful JS code existing on your site
          so be aware of who is allowed access to add embeded content.
        - It doesn't currently have a way to just display part of the html content. You will need to ensure
          it is designed just display "content" and doesn't have its own headers and footers.
        - Since its an iframe any content must use its own css. This can also lead to content that doesn't
          fit the site theme.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        This add-on can be seen in action at the following sites:

        Installation
        ------------

                collective.embedcontent
