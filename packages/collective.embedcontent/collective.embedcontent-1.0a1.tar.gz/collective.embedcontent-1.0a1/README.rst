collective.embedcontent
=======================

Collective.embed provides a way to install a zip or single html file of content into a plone site. 

Features
--------

- Content is displayed inside an iframe in a content view or in a mosaic tile.

- Content is not filtered like pasted html in the visual editor. This allows for
  - subsites authored by other tools such newsletter software. Linked html works but need to be relative.
  - social media JS embed codes

Notes
-----
- Note this does increase the likelyhood of harmful JS code existing on your site
  so be aware of who is allowed access to add embeded content.
- It doesn't currently have a way to just display part of the html content. You will need to ensure
  it is designed just display "content" and doesn't have its own headers and footers.
- Since its an iframe any content must use its own css. This can also lead to content that doesn't
  fit the site theme.

Examples
--------

This add-on can be seen in action at the following sites:
- https://www.mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au (frontpage twitter and facebook tiles and under Media > Newsletters)

------------

Install collective.embedcontent by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.embedcontent


and then running ``bin/buildout``

Once installed and activated on your site there is an EmbedContent content type you can add anywhere in your site.
