Description: # Create Python App
        
         * refered as CPA
         * Free software: Apache Software License 2.0
        
        ## Goal
        
        Full life cycle management for python apps and libs.  Create python boilerplate, develop, update boilerplate and publish.
        
         * Single point of truth for project parameters
        
        
        ## State
        
        The repository contains a **WIP MVP** to evaliuate different technologies, workflows and user interface.  It's quick and dirty.
        
        **Not suited for production work.**  Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.
        
        
        ## Opinionated
        
        The software is based on decisions regarding project structure and
        used libraries.
        
        Current decisions (effecting projects managed with cpa, not just cpa's developemt itself):
        
         * py.test to run tests
         * git for version control
         * type annotations are good
         * gitlab ci integration
        
        In evaluation:
        
         * pipenv vs [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)
         * mypy vs pytype
        
        
        Some of them might end up being configurable, some might never be configurable.  Keeping CPA simple might take priority.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        Commands:
          create   create new project
          dist     create distributables
          publish  publish to pypi
          test     run tests
          update   update current project
        
        ```
        
        
        ## TODO
        
         * Explain why
