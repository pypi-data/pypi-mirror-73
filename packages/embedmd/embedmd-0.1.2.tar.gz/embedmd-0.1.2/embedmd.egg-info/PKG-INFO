Description: 
        # embedmd
        
        Note: this project has been stalled. The [markdown in HTML](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/md_in_html/) extension of the [Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) package does not have any good feature to embed tables into HTML. That was my main use case.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install embedmd
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/kylepollina/embedmd
        cd embedmd
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Place this text in your HTML file where you want to embed markdown:
        
        ```html
        '#INCLUDE filename.md'
        ```
        
        Where `filename.md` is pointing to the markdown file you wish to embed in that spot of the HTML file.
        
        ```shell
        [~]$ embedmd input.html optional_output.html
        ```
        
        `embedmd` supports an optional output file if you wish to not overwrite the original file
