MOCPy is a Python library allowing easy creation      and manipulation of MOCs (Multi-Order Coverage maps).      MOC is an IVOA standard      enabling description of arbitrary sky regions.
Based on the HEALPix sky tessellation, it maps regions on the sky      into hierarchically grouped predefined cells.
An experimental support for TMOC (temporal MOC) has been added since version 0.4.0.     It allows creation, parsing and comparison of TMOCs. 

Space & Time coverages (STMOC) are an extension of MOC to add time information. It is possible to get a TMOC by querying      a STMOC with a MOC and/or get a MOC by querying a STMOC with a TMOC.
