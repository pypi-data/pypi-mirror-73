mailadm tool (beta)
======================

mailadm is the reference administration tool for creating
and removing e-mail accounts ("burner accounts"). It can
generate QR codes and URLs to be used for performing
account creation.

The https://delta.chat messenger (on all platforms)
has support to scan QR codes and setup e-mail accounts
easily.

See the `docs/index.rst` file or https://mailadm.readthedocs.io for more info.
