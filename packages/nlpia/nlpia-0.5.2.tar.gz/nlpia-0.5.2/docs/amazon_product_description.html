    <b>Summary</b><div><br />
        <i>Natural Language Processing in Action</i> is your guide to creating machines that understand human language using the power of Python with its ecosystem of packages dedicated to NLP and AI.<br />
        <br />
        Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. All examples are included in the open source `nlpia` package on python.org and github.com, complete with a conda environment and Dockerfile to help you get going quickly on any platform.<br />

    <b>About the Technology</b><div><br />
        Recent advances in deep learning empower applications to understand text and speech with extreme accuracy. The result? Chatbots that can imitate real people, meaningful resume-to-job matches, superb predictive search, and automatically generated document summaries--all at a low cost. New techniques, along with accessible tools like Keras and TensorFlow, make professional-quality NLP easier than ever before.<br />

    <b>About the Book</b><div><br />
        <i>Natural Language Processing in Action</i> is your guide to building machines that can read and interpret human language. In it, you'll use readily available Python packages to capture the meaning in text and react accordingly. The book expands traditional NLP approaches to include neural networks, modern deep learning algorithms, and generative techniques as you tackle real-world problems like extracting dates and names, composing text, and answering free-form questions.<br />
