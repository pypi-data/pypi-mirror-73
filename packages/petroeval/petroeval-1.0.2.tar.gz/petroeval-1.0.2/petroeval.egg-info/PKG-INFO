Description: Formation Evaluation Package
        
        Formation evaluation module for geoscientists, petrophysicists for easy and quick quantitative petrophysical analysis.
        
        Features include:
        
        -   Calculating petrophysical parameters for reservoir quantization:
                Parameters like Total Porosity, Effective Porosity, Water Saturation, Oil Saturation
        
        -   Estimating Reservoir Volumes:
                        Gross rock Volume
                        Net to Gross Volume
                        Net Pay of Reservoir section
        
        -   Visualizing well logs for correlation
        
        -   Resolving missing values in well logs
        
        -   Automatic correction of estimated properties
        
        Subsequent release features:
        
        -   Total oil or gas in place
        -   Permeability of reservoir section
