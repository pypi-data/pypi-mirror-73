Formation Evaluation Package

Formation evaluation module for geoscientists, petrophysicists for easy and quick quantitative petrophysical analysis.

Features include:

-   Calculating petrophysical parameters for reservoir quantization:
        Parameters like Total Porosity, Effective Porosity, Water Saturation, Oil Saturation

-   Estimating Reservoir Volumes:
                Gross rock Volume
                Net to Gross Volume
                Net Pay of Reservoir section

-   Visualizing well logs for correlation

-   Resolving missing values in well logs

-   Automatic correction of estimated properties

Subsequent release features:

-   Total oil or gas in place
-   Permeability of reservoir section
