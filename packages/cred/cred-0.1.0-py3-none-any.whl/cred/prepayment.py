        Object that calculates repayment for open prepayment terms. `period_breakage` defines the repayment amount if
        the date of repayment is not on a payment date and interest period end date. Includes regularly scheduled
        payments due on the date or repayment, if any.

        * **None:**  Repayment amount equals the outstanding balance with adjustments for any pre-paid amounts or amounts
        unpaid. For example, if the interest period ends on the first of the month but isn't paid until the third due to
        business day adjustments, the repayment amount on the second will equal the outstanding principal amount plus
        the regularly scheduled payment due on the third.
        * **"accrued_an_unpaid":** In addition unpaid amounts, adds accrued interest to the repayment amount. Building on
        the previous example, this method would add one day of interest (from the first to the second) to the total
        repayment amount.
        * **"full_period":** If the repayment date is on any day other than the last day of an interest period, includes
        interest that accrues over the entire period. Building on the first example again, the "full_period" repayment
        amount would equal the outstanding principal plus the unpaid amount due on the third plus the interest that

        Prepayment estimator object for loan exit costs based on a percentage of outstanding principal.

        Repayment costs under this structure are defined by a list of percentages in decimal form for each premium level
        and a matching list of date offsets that denote the expiration date for each premium level.

        Date offsets are applied to the borrowing's first regular period start date and then adjusted based on the
        borrowing's `adjust_pmt_date` method. Offsets are interpreted as expiration dates, so any date on or after a
        given expiration date would use the following premium level. Repayment dates on or after the final expiration
        date are assumed to be open.

        Premiums are applied to the to the-current outstanding principal amount outstanding. Note that the outstanding
        principal balance is adjusted based on amortization payments made on payment dates rather than interest period
        start and end dates.

        Period breakage determines how interest payments are determined if the repayment date is not on a payment date.

        Prepayment class for estimating yield maintenance on PeriodicBorrowings. Discounts remaining payments (either to

        The index rate will can be structured to mirror either the term of the remaining payments (i.e. maturity or
        the open date depending on which date the yeild maintenance is structured to) or the weighted average life (WAL)
