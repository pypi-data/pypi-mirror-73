        Generate new projects from git repositories
        
        new is a command to create new projects based on existing git repos. It simply shallow clones a repository to a directory with your specified new project name, and cleans up the git files like they were never there. It also supports string replacement.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can create new project from any github repository with just the username and project name
        
        The following command will create a new project for you based on this one:
        ```sh
        new myNewProject divanvisagie/new
        ```
        
        You can also specify a URL to any git repository that you have access to:
        ```sh
        new myNewProject git@gitlab.com:divan/new.git
        ```
        
        These examples are just simple clones though, new also lets authors configure a 
        repository so that it will prompt you to replace strings that you may want to rename
        for your project.
        
        You can give it a try with:
        
        ```sh
        new myNewProject divanvisagie/kotlin-tested-seed
        ```
        
        You will see that it prompts you to replace the package name, just pressing enter will skip this and keep the name:
        
        ```sh
        > new myNewProject divanvisagie/kotlin-tested-seed
        Creating testbed from https://github.com/divanvisagie/kotlin-tested-seed.git 
        Enumerating objects: 14, done.
        Counting objects: 100% (14/14), done.
        Compressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.
        Total 14 (delta 0), reused 10 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
        
        Enter replacement text for com.divanvisagie.example
        
            text       : com.divanvisagie.example
            description: The package name
        
        > com.divanvisagie.mynewproject
        ```
        
        The reason we see this is because the `kotlin-tested-seed` repository contains a `.new.yml` file at its root:
        
        ```yml
        replace:
          strings:
            - match: com.divanvisagie.example
              description: The package name 
        ```
        
        You can configure as many match strings as you want in your own seed projects.
