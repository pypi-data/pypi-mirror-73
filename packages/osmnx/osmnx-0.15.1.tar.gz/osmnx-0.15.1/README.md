# OSMnx

**Python for street networks**

Retrieve, model, analyze, and visualize OpenStreetMap street networks and other spatial data.

**Citation info**: Boeing, G. 2017. "[OSMnx: New Methods for Acquiring, Constructing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Complex Street Networks](https://geoffboeing.com/publications/osmnx-complex-street-networks/)." *Computers, Environment and Urban Systems* 65, 126-139. doi:10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.05.004



## Features

**OSMnx** is a Python package that lets you download spatial geometries and model, project, visualize, and analyze real-world street networks from OpenStreetMap's APIs. Users can download and model walkable, drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code, and then easily analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, speed/travel time, and network routing.

OSMnx is built on top of geopandas, networkx, and matplotlib and interacts with OpenStreetMap's APIs to:

  * Download street networks anywhere in the world with a single line of code
  * Download other infrastructure types, place boundaries, building footprints, and points of interest
  * Download by city name, polygon, bounding box, or point/address + network distance
  * Download drivable, walkable, bikeable, or all street networks
  * Download node elevations and calculate edge grades (inclines)
  * Impute missing speeds and calculate graph edge travel times
  * Simplify and correct the network's topology to clean-up nodes and consolidate intersections
  * Fast map-matching of points, routes, or trajectories to nearest graph edges or nodes
  * Save networks to disk as shapefiles, geopackages, and GraphML
  * Save/load street network to/from a local .osm xml file
  * Conduct topological and spatial analyses to automatically calculate dozens of indicators
  * Calculate and visualize street bearings and orientations
  * Calculate and visualize shortest-path routes that minimize distance, travel time, elevation, etc
  * Visualize street network as a static map or interactive leaflet web map
  * Visualize travel distance and travel time with isoline and isochrone maps
  * Plot figure-ground diagrams of street networks and/or building footprints

Examples and demonstrations of these features are in the [examples repo](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples). More feature development details are in the change log.



## Installation

If you have any trouble with the installation, read the [docs](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/).

You can install OSMnx with [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/osmnx):

```
conda config --prepend channels conda-forge

```

Alternatively, you can run OSMnx + Jupyter directly from its official [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/gboeing/osmnx) or you can install OSMnx via pip if you already have its dependencies installed on your system.

## How to use OSMnx

For a quick overview of OSMnx, see this [demo notebook](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/00-osmnx-features-demo.ipynb).



### Introduction

Import OSMnx, download and model Manhattan's drivable street network in just one line of code, then visualize it in one more:

```python
import osmnx as ox
G = ox.graph_from_place('Manhattan, New York, USA', network_type='drive')
fig, ax = ox.plot_graph(G)
```
![](docs/figures/manhattan.png)

In a couple more lines of code you can examine intersection density, network circuity, average block size, PageRank, betweenness centrality, connectivity, spatial distribution of dead-ends or 4-way intersections, etc for anywhere in the world:

```python
basic_stats = ox.basic_stats(G)
print(basic_stats['circuity_avg'])

extended_stats = ox.extended_stats(G)
print(extended_stats['pagerank_max_node'])
```

You can just as easily download and work with [amenities/points of interest](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/osmnx.html#osmnx.pois.pois_from_place), [building footprints](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/10-building-footprints.ipynb), and [node elevation/street grade](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/12-node-elevations-edge-grades.ipynb) data.



### Download and model street networks

OSMnx lets you download street network data and build topologically corrected multidigraphs, project to UTM and plot the networks, and save the street network as SVGs, GraphML files, .osm files, shapefiles, or geopackages for later use. The street networks are directed and preserve one-way directionality. API responses can be cached locally so OSMnx doesn't have to request the same data from the API multiple times - saving bandwidth, increasing speed, and enabling reproducibility.

You can download a street network by providing OSMnx any of the following (demonstrated in the examples):
  - a bounding box
  - a lat-long point plus a distance (either distance along the network, or cardinal)
  - an address plus a distance (either distance along the network, or cardinal)
  - a place name or list of place names (for OSMnx to automatically geocode and get the boundary of)
  - a polygon of the desired street network's boundaries

You can also specify several different built-in network types:
  - `drive` - get drivable public streets (but not service roads)
  - `drive_service` - get drivable streets, including service roads
  - `walk` - get all streets and paths that pedestrians can use (this network type ignores one-way directionality)
  - `bike` - get all streets and paths that cyclists can use
  - `all` - download all non-private OSM streets and paths
  - `all_private` - download all OSM streets and paths, including private-access ones

Or you can define your own fine-tuned network type using OSMnx's `custom_filter` parameter (to get just highways, or railways, canals, etc). For an in-depth demonstration of creating street networks, see [this notebook](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/03-graph-place-queries.ipynb).



### Analyze and visualize street networks

OSMnx allows you to calculate origin-destination routes along the network and quickly visualize them. You can easily visualize elevation, street grade, one-way streets, culs-de-sac, high/low connectivity intersections, building footprints, etc. OSMnx provides built-in capabilities to quickly calculate spatial network metrics like intersection density, average intersection degree, edge density, average street segment length, clustering coefficients, betweenness centrality, etc. For better spatial analysis and visualization, OSMnx lets you project your graph either to a CRS of your choice or automatically to UTM for easy meter-based analysis and projected visualization.

You can also calculate shortest paths with different impedances for network routing and trip simulation, calculate street bearings to analyze network orientation, or snap your own data to the network using OSMnx's fast get nearest node and get nearest edge functions.

For examples of analyzing street networks with OSMnx, see [this notebook](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/06-stats-indicators-centrality.ipynb).



### Correct and simplify street network topology

Simplification is normally done by OSMnx automatically under the hood, but we can break it out to see how it works. OpenStreetMap nodes include intersections, but they also include all the points along a single block where the street curves. The latter are not nodes in the graph theory sense, so we remove them algorithmically and consolidate the set of edges between "true" network nodes into a single edge, but retain the actual spatial geometry. There are two simplification modes, strict and non-strict. The main difference is that unlike strict mode, non-strict mode allows simplification to an expansion graph.

For an in-depth demonstration of topological simplification with OSMnx, see [this notebook](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/04-simplify-graph-consolidate-nodes.ipynb).



### Save street networks, building footprints, or points of interest to disk

OSMnx allows users to save street networks to disk as .osm files, as shapefiles or geopackages to work with in GIS software, as GraphML files to work with in Gephi or NetworkX, and as SVG files to work with in Illustrator. It also allows you to save place boundary geometries, building footprints, or amenities/points of interest to disk as shapefiles or geojson/geopackages via geopandas.

For examples of saving and loading networks to/from disk, see [this notebook](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/05-save-load-networks.ipynb).
