        This is a package used to find stuff that might take you a while to find otherwise.
        
        ### Aguy11 Advice Function
        
        This is a function that gives you a slip of advice from an API that can be found here: https://api.adviceslip.com/advice
        It takes one parameter, display which is a bool that either prints the advice to the terminal or not. It is called by a .advice() function.
        
        ### Aguy11 AsciiMake Function
        
        This is a not-yet-complete function that can find ASCII for the following:
        - A fish: Use 'fish' for model parameter
        - A cat: Use 'cat' for model parameter
        - A wolf: Use 'wolf' for model parameter
        - An egyptian Queen: Use 'egypt' for model parameter
        - Yoda: Use 'yoda' for model parameter

        This function can be called by an .asciimake() function.
        
        
        ### Volume Function
        
        This is a simple function that takes for parameters: x, y, z, display. If you read the above you know what display is and the other parameters are the x, y, and z axis lengths of the model. This function finds the volume of an object, and can be called by a .volume() function
        
        ### Astros_Current

        This function finds a few things about the coronavirus statistics of a state:

        - Number of people who died (Found at index 1 of the result)
        - Number of people tested (Found at index 2 of the result)
